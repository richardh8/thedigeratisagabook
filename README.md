This book is dedicated to my Grandfather, Josef Hechenbichler (1913-1996), who's companion, teachings and proverbs have been essential to my formation as an ingenious and creative human being. And by making me more prepared to go through persistent inner wars with determination in order to overcome my own mind limitations using my own spiritual crafts.
 
Also wanted to dedicate this book to my wife Samyrah, my sons Josef, Patrick, Peter, and daughter Sophie for supporting me to go through this battle, and allowing me time to get inspired, create and write this book.

## Preface
>“Digital Transformation starts with you, not technology…”

The Digital Era comes to flip upside down the conventions, where uncertainty comes at place of certainty, business cases to experimentation, knowledge feuds to democratized information and opened knowledge at the individual, communities and organizational levels. It's ubiquitous and there isn’t a way to move back, if not, to move faster ahead, with intentions to transform society problems and aspirations to new norms of existence. However organizations still struggle with the effectiveness of their digital endeavors, and it has much to do with the starting point of this journey rather than their visions, aspirations and technology procurement. Effective transformation comes from the people, instead of looking at the hiring of the new Chief of Innovation, Digital, Technology, as saviors of a weakened board of executives, or the agile processes, design methods and digital technology. Is not the fact that those elements have no role in the digital transformation journey, but are supporting players and tools, and not the main venue that will lead to significant innovative, adaptive and transformative culture.

Digital Transformation is a journey that has no similar contender transformation program in human history, just put it in this way. You may have experiences in the past from different transformation program backgrounds in your organization, but none has touched all buttons at once in the organization, plus new buttons never thought existed that would trigger desperation in people in some cases. Thus Digital Transformation is so drastically disruptive and so demanding of new mindsets and leadership, some so counterintuitive and far from the executive board consensus, that seems to be an impossible achievement. -“How a caterpillar will transform into a butterfly, right?” Well, we are humans, and by being humans is in our own nature the ability to fulfill the incredible, miraculous and thought impossible achievements. And it may sound a bit off, but this is the intriguing and mesmerizing abilities that folks like Jeff Bezos, Alan Musk, Steve Jobs, Peter Diamandis and many others have been trying to convey to us, maybe touch people like you and me to a new belief system. So if we do not explore a human-centered and oriented approach to Digital Transformation in all levels and areas of the organizations, what you end up having, is a milestone of the transformation here and there, which is not integrated, fully leveraged and efficient to deliver the vision. Is not a big bang either, in terms of technical execution, but a disruption on organizational, leadership and thinking, yes it is indeed, that the foundation, where culture will determine traits for its success, and digital leadership the cornerstone to keep the culture engaged to evolve towards it.

The Digital Transformation is not about your adoption of Cloud-based computing, detached from the Mobile Application Development and Analytics happening on the other side. It’s about an integrated and human-centered and oriented roadmap of your customer and your employees, where your input might be your vision and strategies for the business, but the actual planning, execution and delivery is carried out by empowered individuals obsessed with customer problems, with your willingness to move fast and fail fast as possible, where learning is the key to pave the future ahead in the midst of the darkness of uncertainty. A war is not won if not by its numerous battles.

The take-up of digital accelerators is too low despite the efficacy benefits, so in practice, the discussion does not lie on do or not do digital, but the concrete knowledge and skills to drive digital endeavors ahead. According to the reports, 83% of nonprofit leaders state that their biggest barriers are in the low digital maturity of their organizations, and 98% of them state that they have scarce resources to carry out the digital endeavor. No need of much thinking here, if you perceive that those leaders can’t think outside of the box. They are limited by their persistence in using conventional thinking models, like getting the investment budget, hiring people and hiding behind a desk, and over control their operations that are not core and relevant to their business, plus creating parallel and disconnected streams of projects, stretching thin the entire organization, leading to disengagement. It’s not about a top-down view of the organization, neither something that can be conceived and done in silos, or ivory tower models. Digital leaders must align their objectives first, they must learn about the subject at hand, they need to breathe and experiment digital in their day-to-day lives, truly care about their customers and new ones that they are not even listening to, create an environment of empathy with their employees, customers and the market, so there is a unified and digitized mindset to kick-off the digital transformation journey. I don’t even state a program here, neither a project, because that would bring you to think in the conventional way of getting things done, and structure the plans and actions, like you know what will be done, delivered and deployed in a year or two. Because you won’t know if not 3 months or less ahead, how to know what is the right step to a solid, consistent, healthy and valued feature of the digital capability model to be delivered?

According to the Word Economic Forum, executives must focus on innovation and recognize the positive impact of new business models to society and the environment. Business organizations are facing increasing pressure to innovate continuously, and digital technologies play a major role in those innovations. A rapidly growing digital population is driving new consumption behavior and collective phenomena, facilitating new entrants, directly or indirectly on every industry and commerce. New economies are in development, so choosing the right framework and conditions to enable sustainable digital endeavors seeking the delivery of continuous innovations, are critical ingredients for organizations to thrive.

Thus through many years of personal and direct involvement and engagement on digital initiatives in the business and technology sides, what I saw that aggregated more value, were the cases where we decided to get the empowerment to make decisions, focus on real customers, have a clear model for collaboration of a multi disciplined team, something that we designed and planned, not from a nonsense mandate from the board, and mostly important, a vision that was compelling to everyone, significant to the business results and that had something as rewarding to all members of the team. So leadership is the crucial component to make digital transformation happen at organizations.

After using so many practices, tools, methods, frameworks, models, etc, none of those resulted in much value as those that were driven by the factors I mentioned above, because we were not transforming the people, but the things around them, and everything after a little while just falled back to what was before, with more things and work to be done on the shelf.

## Prologue
The contents of this book have been widely conceived, elaborated and gained shape and form over the past 5 years. Back then, after spending a long career since 1993 working with digital (back then this terminology didn't exist), I came to the realization that the human factor and leadership traits in digital related projects and endeavors, were the most relevant factors of success, and the ones that expressed greatest results, thus my mind just clicked to it, rendering many insights which are written in this book. Nowadays, the human factor is not a new issue and matter, but years ago, that was not recognized as a foundational element for the digital age, which makes us reflect, gain new knowledge about humans and society as never before. In such a fast pace, the digital era of society, businesses and organizations across the globe, set the stage for inconvenient truths to an evolved mind in astonishing science discoveries and applications. So human factor has no true originality anymore, as it has been recognized at large by many in the industry, back lacking the thinking on new paradigms and interests to drive and lead the way, off course in general. So I can say that once you taste it by yourself through your own experience, it makes a whole different story, and takes you to a level that you can't go back, you become aware and conscious, the modern warriors way, blending personal experiences with social ones, in a single continuum of consciousness evolution. The issue around the digital transformation domain, relies truly on its complexity, variety, quality and maturity of the contents, practices, forums, methods, technical parafernalia and demands technical skills associated with it, however it can't be ignored the most common but neglected human traits, and what makes us human, as this is the factor acting the main pillar of sustantionality, as it supports the purpose, moral and ethics of all the journey we are all encompassing, as human beings, we build solutions to problems of our own and the planet, and we can't operate as robots with extreme rationality, like machines, with cold blood in a controlled experiment with limited possibilities of outcome. Of course, complexity is relative, for those who have mastered some knowledge, complexity is drastically decreased, or matters can be simplistic, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, the matter here in regards to the digital transformation domain, is on the fact that needs to be puzzled together holistically, and could not be looked or experienced from outside, it has to come from original experiences in hands on work, in order to bring true value to the digital transformation theme on interested communities that want to thrive on ongoing learning and deep dives in human positive experiences.

I had to be careful not to over simplify contents to not become superficial, but pass on knowledge to people in a democratized and accessible way, with a strong meaning to back it up their learnings, by establishing rapport through ludic styles, storytelling to retain attention and memorization, as well practical circumstances. All in the search to get us to the next levels of innovation and overcome known challenges in a common sense and normalized structure as a body of knowledge. But most importantly, with positive and optimistic purposes, more than ever we should pay attention and build profound empathy to ourselves and humans, and solve wicked problems which we developed tolerance for centuries. If digital comes as a new plain level ground, let's make that as the chance to build a fair, equal and why not, one lovely place for us to grow, build trust, live in harmony within possible reasons.

It all started on defining knowledge domains and how comprehensive, broad and relevant they are for the leaders and people engaged in digital developments. That rendered me with a Digital Transformation Canvas. However after my personal journey and evolution, and facing the challenges ahead of me, many other elements have been appended to this array of experiences, which I call the Digital Hive. You may read this book orderly as laid out, or pick the honeycomb cluster you wish within the eight domains and its general foundations.

I have blissfully and luckily been involved with digital technology projects since I started working at the age of eighteen years old, and it has been an awesome learning journey. I had the chance to experiment, implement and innovate with edgy technologies, practices and methods, and have always been growing professionally and personally, as I could not help if not accept the fact that I am a single conscientious phenoma. I also like to believe I was lucky because beyond working with edgy technologies, I was working on new departments and areas, and new terrain to be built and exploited. And finally, yes, the human beings, because they are the root of everything, without them, my perspectives would be just a small and limited bubble of interpretations, decisions and knowledge.

Also, I'm very thankful for having met distinguished and distinct people that shared with me the passion, the incessant fight against status quo and mediocracy. The warm and profound discussions that connected us even more, which allowed me to learn and put in practice through experiments, projects, programs and operations.

The book is structured in chapters, which have a rationale for it, within it, we have the episodes classified by each domain. Episodes are made of its "branded theme", short inspirational and contextualizable quote, an image from a movie, a caption of that movie, rationale and linkage of of the movie with the theme, describing the problems involved with the theme, and finaly a narrative of the theme

To close this prologue, I wanted to thank you for reading up to here, and I'm very looking forward to knowing you are reading it all, and please, engage me in any ways you want, to discuss it, change it, or just simply, exchange experiences without any commitments or strings attached. Worthwhile conversation points will be appended to the end of this book, let's see what we can make of it, up to you and me.
