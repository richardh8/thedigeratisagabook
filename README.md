This book is dedicated to my Grandfather, Josef Hechenbichler (1913-1996), who's companion, teachings and proverbs have been essential to my formation as an ingenious and creative human being. And by making me more prepared to go through persistent inner wars with determination in order to overcome my own mind limitations using my own spiritual crafts.
 
Also wanted to dedicate this book to my wife Samyrah, my sons Josef, Patrick, Peter, and daughter Sophie for supporting me to go through this battle, and allowing me time to get inspired, create and write this book.

## Preface
>“Digital Transformation starts with you, not technology…”

The Digital Era comes to flip upside down the conventions, where uncertainty comes at place of certainty, business cases to experimentation, knowledge feuds to democratized information and opened knowledge at the individual, communities and organizational levels. It's ubiquitous and there isn’t a way to move back, if not, to move faster ahead, with intentions to transform society problems and aspirations to new norms of existence. However organizations still struggle with the effectiveness of their digital endeavors, and it has much to do with the starting point of this journey rather than their visions, aspirations and technology procurement. Effective transformation comes from the people, instead of looking at the hiring of the new Chief of Innovation, Digital, Technology, as saviors of a weakened board of executives, or the agile processes, design methods and digital technology. Is not the fact that those elements have no role in the digital transformation journey, but are supporting players and tools, and not the main venue that will lead to significant innovative, adaptive and transformative culture.

Digital Transformation is a journey that has no similar contender transformation program in human history, just put it in this way. You may have experiences in the past from different transformation program backgrounds in your organization, but none has touched all buttons at once in the organization, plus new buttons never thought existed that would trigger desperation in people in some cases. Thus Digital Transformation is so drastically disruptive and so demanding of new mindsets and leadership, some so counterintuitive and far from the executive board consensus, that seems to be an impossible achievement. -“How a caterpillar will transform into a butterfly, right?” Well, we are humans, and by being humans is in our own nature the ability to fulfill the incredible, miraculous and thought impossible achievements. And it may sound a bit off, but this is the intriguing and mesmerizing abilities that folks like Jeff Bezos, Alan Musk, Steve Jobs, Peter Diamandis and many others have been trying to convey to us, maybe touch people like you and me to a new belief system. So if we do not explore a human-centered and oriented approach to Digital Transformation in all levels and areas of the organizations, what you end up having, is a milestone of the transformation here and there, which is not integrated, fully leveraged and efficient to deliver the vision. Is not a big bang either, in terms of technical execution, but a disruption on organizational, leadership and thinking, yes it is indeed, that the foundation, where culture will determine traits for its success, and digital leadership the cornerstone to keep the culture engaged to evolve towards it.

The Digital Transformation is not about your adoption of Cloud-based computing, detached from the Mobile Application Development and Analytics happening on the other side. It’s about an integrated and human-centered and oriented roadmap of your customer and your employees, where your input might be your vision and strategies for the business, but the actual planning, execution and delivery is carried out by empowered individuals obsessed with customer problems, with your willingness to move fast and fail fast as possible, where learning is the key to pave the future ahead in the midst of the darkness of uncertainty. A war is not won if not by its numerous battles.

The take-up of digital accelerators is too low despite the efficacy benefits, so in practice, the discussion does not lie on do or not do digital, but the concrete knowledge and skills to drive digital endeavors ahead. According to the reports, 83% of nonprofit leaders state that their biggest barriers are in the low digital maturity of their organizations, and 98% of them state that they have scarce resources to carry out the digital endeavor. No need of much thinking here, if you perceive that those leaders can’t think outside of the box. They are limited by their persistence in using conventional thinking models, like getting the investment budget, hiring people and hiding behind a desk, and over control their operations that are not core and relevant to their business, plus creating parallel and disconnected streams of projects, stretching thin the entire organization, leading to disengagement. It’s not about a top-down view of the organization, neither something that can be conceived and done in silos, or ivory tower models. Digital leaders must align their objectives first, they must learn about the subject at hand, they need to breathe and experiment digital in their day-to-day lives, truly care about their customers and new ones that they are not even listening to, create an environment of empathy with their employees, customers and the market, so there is a unified and digitized mindset to kick-off the digital transformation journey. I don’t even state a program here, neither a project, because that would bring you to think in the conventional way of getting things done, and structure the plans and actions, like you know what will be done, delivered and deployed in a year or two. Because you won’t know if not 3 months or less ahead, how to know what is the right step to a solid, consistent, healthy and valued feature of the digital capability model to be delivered?

According to the Word Economic Forum, executives must focus on innovation and recognize the positive impact of new business models to society and the environment. Business organizations are facing increasing pressure to innovate continuously, and digital technologies play a major role in those innovations. A rapidly growing digital population is driving new consumption behavior and collective phenomena, facilitating new entrants, directly or indirectly on every industry and commerce. New economies are in development, so choosing the right framework and conditions to enable sustainable digital endeavors seeking the delivery of continuous innovations, are critical ingredients for organizations to thrive.

Thus through many years of personal and direct involvement and engagement on digital initiatives in the business and technology sides, what I saw that aggregated more value, were the cases where we decided to get the empowerment to make decisions, focus on real customers, have a clear model for collaboration of a multi disciplined team, something that we designed and planned, not from a nonsense mandate from the board, and mostly important, a vision that was compelling to everyone, significant to the business results and that had something as rewarding to all members of the team. So leadership is the crucial component to make digital transformation happen at organizations.

After using so many practices, tools, methods, frameworks, models, etc, none of those resulted in much value as those that were driven by the factors I mentioned above, because we were not transforming the people, but the things around them, and everything after a little while just falled back to what was before, with more things and work to be done on the shelf.

## Prologue
The contents of this book have been widely conceived, elaborated and gained shape and form over the past 5 years. Back then, after spending a long career since 1993 working with digital (back then this terminology didn't exist), I came to the realization that the human factor and leadership traits in digital related projects and endeavors, were the most relevant factors of success, and the ones that expressed greatest results, thus my mind just clicked to it, rendering many insights which are written in this book. Nowadays, the human factor is not a new issue and matter, but years ago, that was not recognized as a foundational element for the digital age, which makes us reflect, gain new knowledge about humans and society as never before. In such a fast pace, the digital era of society, businesses and organizations across the globe, set the stage for inconvenient truths to an evolved mind in astonishing science discoveries and applications. So human factor has no true originality anymore, as it has been recognized at large by many in the industry, back lacking the thinking on new paradigms and interests to drive and lead the way, off course in general. So I can say that once you taste it by yourself through your own experience, it makes a whole different story, and takes you to a level that you can't go back, you become aware and conscious, the modern warriors way, blending personal experiences with social ones, in a single continuum of consciousness evolution. The issue around the digital transformation domain, relies truly on its complexity, variety, quality and maturity of the contents, practices, forums, methods, technical parafernalia and demands technical skills associated with it, however it can't be ignored the most common but neglected human traits, and what makes us human, as this is the factor acting the main pillar of sustantionality, as it supports the purpose, moral and ethics of all the journey we are all encompassing, as human beings, we build solutions to problems of our own and the planet, and we can't operate as robots with extreme rationality, like machines, with cold blood in a controlled experiment with limited possibilities of outcome. Of course, complexity is relative, for those who have mastered some knowledge, complexity is drastically decreased, or matters can be simplistic, such as Einstein's theory of relativity, the matter here in regards to the digital transformation domain, is on the fact that needs to be puzzled together holistically, and could not be looked or experienced from outside, it has to come from original experiences in hands on work, in order to bring true value to the digital transformation theme on interested communities that want to thrive on ongoing learning and deep dives in human positive experiences.

I had to be careful not to over simplify contents to not become superficial, but pass on knowledge to people in a democratized and accessible way, with a strong meaning to back it up their learnings, by establishing rapport through ludic styles, storytelling to retain attention and memorization, as well practical circumstances. All in the search to get us to the next levels of innovation and overcome known challenges in a common sense and normalized structure as a body of knowledge. But most importantly, with positive and optimistic purposes, more than ever we should pay attention and build profound empathy to ourselves and humans, and solve wicked problems which we developed tolerance for centuries. If digital comes as a new plain level ground, let's make that as the chance to build a fair, equal and why not, one lovely place for us to grow, build trust, live in harmony within possible reasons.

It all started on defining knowledge domains and how comprehensive, broad and relevant they are for the leaders and people engaged in digital developments. That rendered me with a Digital Transformation Canvas. However after my personal journey and evolution, and facing the challenges ahead of me, many other elements have been appended to this array of experiences, which I call the Digital Hive. You may read this book orderly as laid out, or pick the honeycomb cluster you wish within the eight domains and its general foundations.

I have blissfully and luckily been involved with digital technology projects since I started working at the age of eighteen years old, and it has been an awesome learning journey. I had the chance to experiment, implement and innovate with edgy technologies, practices and methods, and have always been growing professionally and personally, as I could not help if not accept the fact that I am a single conscientious phenoma. I also like to believe I was lucky because beyond working with edgy technologies, I was working on new departments and areas, and new terrain to be built and exploited. And finally, yes, the human beings, because they are the root of everything, without them, my perspectives would be just a small and limited bubble of interpretations, decisions and knowledge.

Also, I'm very thankful for having met distinguished and distinct people that shared with me the passion, the incessant fight against status quo and mediocracy. The warm and profound discussions that connected us even more, which allowed me to learn and put in practice through experiments, projects, programs and operations.

The book is structured in chapters, which have a rationale for it, within it, we have the episodes classified by each domain. Episodes are made of its "branded theme", short inspirational and contextualizable quote, an image from a movie, a caption of that movie, rationale and linkage of of the movie with the theme, describing the problems involved with the theme, and finaly a narrative of the theme

To close this prologue, I wanted to thank you for reading up to here, and I'm very looking forward to knowing you are reading it all, and please, engage me in any ways you want, to discuss it, change it, or just simply, exchange experiences without any commitments or strings attached. Worthwhile conversation points will be appended to the end of this book, let's see what we can make of it, up to you and me.

- [Accepting the duality of the world](1-accepting_the_duality_of_the_world.md)
> "The movie "The Matrix" illustrates the duality of the real and digital worlds and how they promote a single experience. Similarly, a company seeking digital transformation must excel in both physical and digital spheres, delivering value to clients and stakeholders regardless of the channel. To provide an integrated and relevant experience, it is necessary to recognize who is performing a certain action and activate their histories, preferences, and other information in real-time. The context of consumer actions and their expectations of agility, transparency, and efficiency created by the digital environment should be extended to service and physical relationships, promoting consistent experiences that align with the brand's purpose and message."
- [Sense of justice](chapters/chapter-4/2-sense_of_justice.md)
> "The movie John Wick shows the importance of justice for customers, who desire fair answers to their problems. Companies can no longer exist without a focus on customer service, as competition, technology, and social networks increase transparency in consumer relations. Companies seeking digital transformation must monitor their deliveries, anticipate possible nonconformities, and react quickly and seriously to any failures. The sense of justice brings simplicity, and customers expect a personalized approach with recognition of their profile. Transparency, candor, and remedying any errors are essential in treating customers fairly."
- [Transparency is everything](chapters/chapter-4/3-transparency_is_everything.md)
> "In the movie "The Hangover", friends reveal the truth about their wild night in Vegas, showing that honesty is important. Similarly, in the age of transparency, organizations must prioritize transparency and ethics to gain trust from customers, employees, partners, and society. Transparency in products and services, hiring, decisions, and communication are key aspects that impact an organization's reputation. "Glassbox" is a new trend that emphasizes the importance of a company's culture and values being transparent to consumers."
- [The problem is yours](chapters/chapter-4/4-the_problem_is_yours.md)
> "Companies should prioritize efficiently solving customer problems and improving the quality of their products and services, rather than just trying to "enchant" customers through special effects or tactical marketing campaigns, according to an article. Companies must take ownership of problems related to the quality of delivery and use digital tools to understand the customer journey and predict their actions. The article also encourages companies to show commitment to customers when things go wrong, keep communication channels open and establish a partnership with customers for continuous improvement."
- [Designing for significance](chapters/chapter-4/5-designing_for_significance.md)
> "The presence of a sense of purpose and meaning is fundamental for adequate performance in any activity. Clarity in vision, purpose, and meaning is crucial for employee engagement and a company's ability to execute strategically. Consumers demand a broader action concerned with issues of public interest, and businesses with a clear sense of purpose can attract new talent, promote a cooperative culture, and represent a competitive advantage."
- [Diversity as a platform](chapters/chapter-4/6-diversity_as_a_platform.md)
> "Diversity is not just a social inclusion issue but also an important element for organizations to deliver value in the current period. It fosters innovation and increases engagement, which is beneficial for organizations. Companies need to identify the diverse groups and develop communication, motivation, engagement, and development practices that are consistent with each one of them. By adopting diversity as an element of their culture, organizations can enjoy benefits such as a sense of belonging, image of the organization, innovation-friendly environment, and better coping with difficulties. However, leadership plays a significant role in constantly supporting and encouraging diversity in the organization."
- [Zero negative impact, but high positive ones](chapters/chapter-4/7-zero_negative_impact_but_high_positive_ones.md)
> "The exponential growth of companies can be achieved without generating negative impacts on society, economy, and environment. In this era, it's crucial to create solutions with high positive impacts for society while minimizing negative ones. Today, the focus is on reducing the negative impact to the user in their purchase and use of products, including disposal, recycling, and exchange. It is a time to unite the shared economy with the power of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing to create value for customers while caring for the planet."
- [Comprehending abundance and scarcity](chapters/chapter-4/8-comprehending_abundance_and_scarcity.md)
> "In the movie "Men in Black 3," extraterrestrial agents maintain law and order on Earth, and just like them, companies need to develop the ability to see opportunities in abundance and scarcity. Science and technology have allowed the emergence of companies capable of reaching global customers in a few years, generating value and solving problems. Digital transformation offers companies the possibility of quickly adapting to constant change, connecting abundance to scarcity, and becoming exponential organizations with growth rates above their competitors."

## <img src="/images/hive_ux.png" width="50"> [Chapter 5 - Ultimate User Experience (User Experience Domain)](chapters/chapter-5/0-ultimate_user_experience.md)
- [Going out to the streets](chapters/chapter-5/1-going_out_to_the_streets.md)
> "The movie "Now You See Me" inspires the concept of observing customers' day-to-day experiences as a way to understand and design better user experiences. Digital transformation should focus on creating an enchanting user experience, which can only be achieved by leaving your office and confronting the reality of your customers. It is important to observe customers in their environment, without interfering in their experiences, and validate the data collected through open-ended questions. Understanding customers' economic situation, why they seek a service, and how they perceive its value is crucial to designing the entire customer experience."
- [Addiction to problems](chapters/chapter-5/2-addiction_to_problems.md)
> "In the movie "Margin Call," an accountant discovers a problem that leads to a global economic crisis. Companies can also create problems by discouraging free thinking and roboticizing processes, which affects customer experiences. Leaders should encourage people to raise problems and promote problem-solving, and have zero tolerance for customer complaints. A problem-oriented organization attacks problems quickly and continuously, and can reshape and reimagine the customer experience to solve problems. By uniting people inside and outside the organization, companies can create an unfair value proposition through innovation in bringing a new experience of using the solution."
- [New experiences as business opportunities](chapters/chapter-5/3-new_experiences_as_business_opportunities.md)
> "The success of innovative companies is not due solely to technology, good management or business models, but rather to the creation of new experiences that were not previously thought possible. Companies that invest in new user experiences are more attractive to investors, consumers and talent, and have a greater chance of surviving in a competitive market. Therefore, organizations should focus on developing new experiences for their customers, as this is the real competitive advantage that will bring long-term success. Redesigning the organization's thinking model towards UX with full force will bring innovation and attract necessary investments for digital transformation."
- [Tasting your own cupcake](chapters/chapter-5/4-tasting_your_own_cupcake.md)
> "The movie "The Interview" provides an analogy for the concept of Cupcake, which involves creating a small and low-impact prototype to validate a new experience before investing heavily in a larger product or service. Many companies idealize their new business projects without understanding market demands or involving customers. By prioritizing essential functions and validating with a small group of users through a co-creative process, companies can ensure a delightful experience for their customers and minimize risk and costs associated with extensive requirements and debates."
- [This is for yesterday, ok?](chapters/chapter-5/5-this_is_for_yesterday_ok.md)
> "In the movie "Click", Michael Newman is given a remote control that allows him to move backward and forward in time. Designing processes that require learning, many steps, and constant user actions can lead to frustration and users abandoning the product. Automation and artificial intelligence can help minimize processes, freeing up time and energy to focus on the heart of the business and value proposition. Understanding modern consumer trends and anticipating events is key to providing the customer with the desired journey."
- [Designing conversations as user experiences](chapters/chapter-5/6-designing_conversations_as_user_experiences.md)
> "In the movie "Man of Steel", Clark Kent has superpowers, and a customer and employee-centric organization uses design combined with user experience to guide all decisions. The focus is on delivering positive and highly productive experiences that empower users and maximize efficiency, with real digital companies producing results while minimizing resources. Consumers expect automatic reconfiguration of services that adapt to their context, and smart brands will do just that to keep up with changing needs."
- [Sense of belonging](chapters/chapter-5/7-sense_of_belonging.md)
> "n "Dances With Wolves," loyalty comes from purpose. Creating a sense of belonging for customers is more effective than reward programs. Understanding trends in movements and causes is necessary to align with clients' beliefs, while beautiful experiences must deliver personalization and relevance. In the digital era, touchpoints need to be immediate, relevant, and personalized. Modeling moments of truth can adapt functions and content to different user contexts, while inviting users to pilot new versions allows for feedback on design and context."
- [White is the new basic](chapters/chapter-5/8-white_is_the_new_basic.md)

- [What was really your problem?](chapters/chapter-6/1-what_was_really_your_problem.md)
> "The use of technologies and business strategies are so closely fused that it is important to discuss them together. Technologies should be part of the problem-solving process and business improvement, and not treated as something separate from the organization. Practices to avoid include treating other functions as customers, assuming professionals from other areas are not familiar with technology, and treating professionals as multitaskers. Instead, technology-related functions should collaborate with the business to find solutions and work together to achieve goals."
- [The incredible machine](chapters/chapter-6/2-the_incredible_machine.md)
> "The proliferation of technology is changing the way we design technological solutions. Integrating existing solutions is easier than creating something new from scratch, leading to the success of companies that open their solutions to the world, creating vibrant ecosystems through APIs. The focus should be on creating simple solutions to complex problems, innovating on innovations, and having a mindset focused on business opportunities. It may be better to think about participating and creating ecosystems rather than creating internal technological solutions."
- [Where, how and when needed](chapters/chapter-6/3-where_how_and_when_needed.md)
> "The proliferation of smartphones and embedded technology has enabled people to do almost anything they want, wherever they are, and whenever they want.

It is important to understand the solution in its ubiquitous form and offer communication facilities through social networks and messaging services."
- [With your head over the clouds](chapters/chapter-6/4-with_your_head_over_the_clouds.md)
> "Inception taught to us about the relativity and exponentiality of time across layers, cloud computing for organizations during a digital transformation process is how application development and operations teams can move fast by leveraging infrastructure as a service. The use of public clouds has shown lower costs than private clouds, and far from on-premisses datacenters, and paying only for what is used can represent considerable savings. Public clouds are also naturally accessible, allowing employees and customers to have easy access to digital solutions. The article suggests that the flexibility of public clouds is essential for survival in today's fast-changing business environment."
- [Human augmented reality](chapters/chapter-6/5-human_augmented_reality.md)
> "The concept of augmented reality extends beyond VR devices and can be applied in various ways to help us see, hear, perceive, calculate or feel things that our senses are not capable of alone. Augmented reality technologies can be applied during digital transformation to digitize elements of an organization's dynamics and improve employee and customer experiences. Examples of augmented reality technologies include descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics, machine learning, cognitive artificial intelligence, automation, robotization, the internet of things, and VR and AR devices."
- [Simple is safe](chapters/chapter-6/6-simple_is_safer.md)
> "The need for digital transformation has led to the adoption of cloud and IT services, but is the use of digital services over the Internet safe? Snowden highlights the need to ensure security when hosting sensitive data on the Internet. As services become more widely available online, edge protection, simplicity, and easy but secure access should be taken into account to mitigate risks and control points of vulnerability. The use of new approaches like biometrics and social network logins can provide a better experience and increased security."
- [There is an app for that](chapters/chapter-6/7-there_is_an_app_for_that.md)
> "In the TV show "Star Trek: The Next Generation," Data uses devices and algorithms to solve big problems. The digital world was once dominated by hardware, and software was sold in complicated boxes. However, the introduction of the iPhone and the App Store in 2008 changed the pace of innovation. The growth of apps and the integration of APIs allowed for infinite possibilities. Today, there is an app for whatever you need, and existing apps can solve business problems easily and quickly. It is important to remain aware and open-minded."
- [The blockchain fungibility](chapters/chapter-6/8-the_blockchain_fungibility.md)
> "Blockchain technology, which supports cryptocurrencies, can revolutionize the world economy with its ability to facilitate collaboration and track any type of transaction or interaction. Blockchain can also provide privacy protection and transparency. As a distributed database, everyone has a record of everything that happens, which introduces inviolable transparency. The financial market can be implemented in a decentralized way using blockchain. Blockchain can also transform markets such as the music industry, ensuring that value for the work performed is distributed to authors and musicians, without intermediaries. Digital transformation journeys should include knowledge of blockchain to lead transformations."

> "Combining existing technologies to create recombinant innovations is vital for organizations to remain relevant in the market during the exponential growth of technological innovations. The digital transformation journey is an opportunity to identify specialized partnerships to assist in combining technologies for innovation. The exponentiality of innovations is due to recombinant innovations, where new innovations emerge from recombining existing ones, making it vital for organizations to keep up with current technologies and trends to remain relevant."
- [Assembling your value chain](chapters/chapter-7/2-assembling_your_value_chain.md)
> "During digital transformation, organizations should understand the difference between Supply Chain and Value Chain, identify current goals, and establish clear strategies for partnerships to design an Integral Value Chain architecture with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, innovation, and commitment. The two main models of thinking about the Value Chain are "Integral Value Chain" and "Modular Value Chain", with the former focusing on a win-win relationship of trust and collaboration with partners towards long-term goals, and the latter emphasizing short-term individual gains."
- [Dialoging your relationships](chapters/chapter-7/3-dialoging_your_relationships.md)
> "Partnerships are essential for organizations to succeed and focus on delivering value to customers. Fine-tuning a partnership requires cultural alignment, mutual gains, reciprocity, and learning. Ongoing communication and trust are important to build a strong relationship and manage risks. Real partnerships share vulnerability and work together to create new possibilities for the future. Building true partnerships can differentiate organizations in the marketplace and make the process more fun."
