>In the movie "Fight Club", Edward Norton, an employee of an insurance company, meets Tyler Durden, who understands Edward's frustrations and emptiness. Together they create Fight Club, an idea so innovative that it brought together hundreds of men around a single purpose.

Why are we seeing so many innovations being released lately, communicated and experienced by everyone? Why are we witnessing a sea change in the way organizations do business? Why are we talking and practicing so much digital transformation?

If you are over 40 years old, stop for a moment, look at your past and your parents' past, you will notice that the frequency of innovations is recent, from the last 10 years. A new reality that started during the 20th century and continues, exponentially, evolving through the 21st century. But what is the reason for this? Why now and why exponential?

To answer this question, we have to initially talk about the term technology. Human beings have intelligence capable of creating tools to facilitate their work and also manipulate aspects of nature to make their lives more comfortable and safe. Also, to elaborate the answer to the above questions, we will have to go back some time in the past.

Since the dawn of civilization, the human race has been developing technologies to improve its quality of life, whether with fire, the wheel, the domestication of animals and agriculture. However, until a certain point in history, these technological innovations occurred with a very low frequency. Take the case of forms of transport. Since the beginning of civilization, animals have been used for traction. This was the reality for over 5000 years, until at the beginning of the 20th century, just 120 years ago, animal traction was replaced by cars.

What we are experiencing recently is an exponentiality in innovations, and the reason for this is what are often called recombinant innovations. Once you have some innovative technologies, new innovations will emerge from the recombination of existing ones. And this is exponential, as more innovations emerge, and these recombine into new innovations. So what we are experiencing is the exponentiality of innovations. Let's continue with the example of forms of transport. Before, from animal traction to cars, now, just in a few years, from cars to cars with the addition of computing power and sensors, and we will have autonomous cars. The self-driving car is a recombinant innovation. It combines several technologies such as GPS, Machine Learning, Cognitive Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, etc, which are already available and allow something new to be created. If we look at most current innovations, almost all of them are recombinant innovations, which are made up of layers and layers of previous innovations.

A digital transformation journey is the time to look at current technologies and innovations and try to combine them to innovate. This way of thinking and acting ensures that the organization remains relevant in its market. However, as the reality of innovation is currently exponential, most organizations are unable to keep up with everything that is being created in the various areas of interest. Thus, it is vital to look at the market and identify specialized partnerships that help in the identification of technologies and trends. And that can assist in the combination of these technologies for innovation in the design, planning and execution of continuous delivery of integrative services of innovations.
