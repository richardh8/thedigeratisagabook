# Startup as SaaS

>"The use of startups as SaaS (Software as a Service) is helping large companies to scale their productivity and to design and launch innovative products and services. By partnering with startups, large corporations can incorporate innovative products into their portfolios and leverage their potential. It is important for companies to be attentive to the search and construction of new partners, glimpsing the startup market with great frequency and attention, and avoiding the misconception of trying to create their own solutions and tools."

>In the movie “The Circle”, Mae Holland joins the Circle organization, which produces all kinds of software integrated with social networks, Cloud, AI, and IoT. Your work routine with customer service uses highly productive and gamified tools, with real-time monitoring of your performance, all in the cloud from any device, including SeeChange, a high resolution camera the size of a marble, connected to the internet and all the technologies present in a smartphone.

The strengthening of startups as support partners for large companies is one of the new developments in the business world in recent years. Such initiatives help small businesses to develop and evolve. Also, large corporations have the chance to acquire knowledge and experience in developing solutions in a fast, innovative and lean way. And by partnering with startups, they can eventually incorporate innovative products into their portfolios.

However, the great challenge for large companies is to make these partnerships more than just providing a service. It is necessary to count on partners that bring efficiency and adherence to its purpose and culture, maximizing the results and synergies of this union.

Although the startup universe is hot, there are companies that prefer to try to create their own solutions and tools. Even if it costs you to lose focus on your core business. This is a misconception. To remain competitive in their deliveries, they need to focus on their core business, and this involves delivering parts of the value creation process to more agile partners.

Don't want to recreate the wheel. Therefore, the first challenge is to entrust parts of the process to a partner and, then, develop a breadth in this relationship that promotes the company to be able to leverage all the strategic potential in a given dimension of the business.

One should not think about tools per se, but the intelligence that will be the basis for using them and generating value through them. To achieve this condition, it is not necessary, most of the time, to rely on expensive and grandiose solutions, which sometimes end up underused and which, in many cases, only reflect the notion that, once the contracting of a Saas is made, “the problems are resolved”.

Therefore, it is essential for companies to be attentive to the search and construction of new partners, glimpsing the startup market with great frequency and attention. Many solutions that a large company would like to have in its portfolio can be available in the market in a shorter time and could deliver and at a much lower cost compared to in-house development. In addition, the solutions can be much more efficient and coherent with your initial need than had been thought, due to the innovation aspects that were incorporated.

In a way, the use of startups as SaaS allows large companies to scale their productivity in the design, implementation and launch of innovative products and services. And as this use is given as a service, the company can guarantee investment in line with its capabilities, avoiding financial overload. And as secondary results, we have startups looking at the company's problems from the outside in, allowing revisions and transformations that can bring surprising results.
