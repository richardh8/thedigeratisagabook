# Assembling your value chain

>"During digital transformation, organizations should understand the difference between Supply Chain and Value Chain, identify current goals, and establish clear strategies for partnerships to design an Integral Value Chain architecture with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, innovation, and commitment. The two main models of thinking about the Value Chain are "Integral Value Chain" and "Modular Value Chain", with the former focusing on a win-win relationship of trust and collaboration with partners towards long-term goals, and the latter emphasizing short-term individual gains."

Before getting into the subject of value chain construction itself, we must understand some important concepts. There is the Supply Chain, known as the Supply Chain, and there is the Value Chain, known as the Value Chain. Supply Chain is understood as matters related to logistics and material flow, information flow or financial flow. And Value Chain, on the other hand, focuses on understanding the value of a chain in relation to the organization's core activities. It is directly related to who creates value, where the value is created and how that value is created. And it also refers to how this creation and delivery of value is carried out in a coherent and consistent way.

Another way to think about this distinction is: in a supply chain, the focus of the question is on how to make it more efficient. On how to make it more sustainable and how to reconcile conflicting goals such as efficiency and resilience. Thinking about Value Chain, the questions are related to how it would be possible to change the competitive environment, identifying competitive advantages through the design of a new value chain from start to finish.

But how should organizations currently think about reviewing or redesigning their Value Chains? Well, there are two main models of how to think about your Value Chain. And these models are conflicting with each other. And they are called “Integral Value Chain” and “Modular Value Chain”.

The application of one model or another helps organizations in the following question: Does our organization work with partners in a collaborative way towards long-term goals, which, in a way, are common or, each of us is working for himself, aiming the short term? The relationship is a win-win or all-nothing partnership. As an example we have: if an organization depends on a supplier and the supplier raises his price as he wants, he wins and the organization loses. This is an all-nothing relationship. If the organization employs staff, and it tightens the salaries and suggests that it can outsource the service. This is also an all-nothing relationship. The all-nothing is of the “Modular Value Chain” type.

In an Integral Value Chain, where win-win prevails, the organization builds a relationship of trust with its suppliers, sharing innovation, and in search of continuous improvements to add automation, intelligence and innovations. The attitude in this model is to be together and collectively benefit from innovations. There is a long-term trust in this case.

In this way, during digital transformation journeys, organizations must design and question their Integral Value Chain architecture, and identify the models in force there. You should discuss existing goals and trust relationships, identify new and alternative partners, especially those related to digital technologies, and establish the correct model for each. One can think of successful short-term partnerships to build a pilot product. And interesting gains can be made when establishing long-term trusting partnerships with technology infrastructure providers, where innovations can be shared in a win-win model. There is no better or worse model. The important thing is to establish clear strategies for each partnership with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and innovation. And who are committed and engaged in the massive transformative purpose that comes from their digital transformation journey.
