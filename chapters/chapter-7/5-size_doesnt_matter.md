>In the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy movie, Frodo Baggins is a little Hobbit who receives the ring forged by Sauron the Dark Lord from his uncle Bilbo, which had been stolen from Gollum. Frodo is responsible for leading the ring to the lavas of Mount Doom to destroy the ring forever. Without the ring's destruction, Middle-earth was doomed to fear and succumb to the forces of evil.

Innovating is not easy. Creating a revolutionary product from scratch or solving a complex problem within an organization in a simple way requires a lot of intellectual effort. And we know that many thinking heads working together to solve a problem are much more efficient than isolated heads, each trying to solve a problem individually.

But, to transform and innovate it is necessary more than just thinking heads together. The problem needs to be solved. Something that can motivate people to work together. It will also require a large library of knowledge, a laboratory equipped for experiments and an integrated environment where those involved can interact freely and at any time.

If we go back to a not-too-distant past, say, 30 years. Where could we find an environment with these characteristics? A place where a team can work, containing a complete library and labs for experiments? Well, that required a lot of resources. A physical location large and comfortable enough was not a big issue, but the library and labs were expensive and spacious. Something that we would only find in large organizations, be they companies or universities.

Therefore, transforming and innovating was something only possible for large organizations. And it was only possible for those with a lot of resources.

We currently see news of so-called unicorns. Tiny organizations that came up with innovative product ideas or solving complex problems. Some of these organizations today have become large. But they were born tiny, sometimes with the idea of ​​one person or a small group of motivated people.

But why is this possible now? Something that was previously inconceivable. Someone, “out of nowhere”, comes up with a revolutionary idea, creates a startup, starts a new business, sometimes something that no one had ever thought possible and displaces large organizations that were already established in that market?

Well, it's all about the environment. What was once expensive is now available to everyone. Let's think for a moment.

Problems to be solved, we all have them. But the Internet and the digital integration of people have given us different ways to solve such everyday problems. It allowed people from anywhere in the world to think of solutions to problems that many other people have anywhere in the world. And solving the problem of a portion of the world's population can be a great opportunity.

To innovate it is necessary to “connect the dots”. It takes a lot of knowledge and technology. A great library. Today any of us can, at any time, learn any subject. Simply open the browser on your smartphone and search. The library, once expensive and spacious, is now literally at our fingertips and at a paltry cost.

And the labs? Comprehensive digital solutions require sophisticated equipment. Sometimes almost exclusive equipment to be able to execute complex programs. Before, they were expensive and needed to be acquired, today, they can be rented by time of use and are also at our fingertips. In the same way as the library, they can be hired and used from your smartphone.

And the thinking heads? They must be together, work together to solve problems and collaborate continuously. Before, there was only one option. They should be physically together at all times to encourage ongoing interaction. Today, we can establish high-performance teams with members residing in different cities, different countries and different contingents. And just like the previous features, contact with all the people of the world is at your fingertips.

So today, anyone in the world who has an innovative idea that can solve the world's problems is fully able to assemble a small team of heroes and succeed in their journey. Everything you need is there, at your fingertips, in your hand. Today, the size of an organization in no way measures its ability to transform the world. What's up? What problem in the world do you want to start solving today?
