>"The importance of digital influencers in increasing the visibility of products and services is well known, but companies must carefully choose their partners to avoid damage to their brand.

>In the movie "Jaws", Martin Brody is the chief of police on Amity Island, who investigates the death of beachgoers in the area. The city's mayor didn't want tourists to know what was actually happening. Martin sought to close the beaches to bathers, but the mayor was deceiving the population. Together with their partners Matt Hopper, an oceanographer and Quint a shark hunter, they finally find the cause of death.

They arrived as a trend, conquered brands, fell in the taste of consumers and the general public, aroused attention beyond the Internet and established themselves as the newest and most impactful in the world of communication, who are they? The Influencers.

Currently, digital influencers are essential for most companies, as they contribute to increasing the notoriety of their products and services. Instagram, Youtube, Snapchat, Pinterest, blogs and Twitter are some of the social networks, which are already part of the communication strategies of companies, which aim to involve consumers in an experience with their reference personalities. But in this context of digital transformation, are companies aware of the partnerships they choose? Is there something you can't see? Can the influencer destroy your brand?

We all know the importance of influencers in digital times and how they are able to bring information about products and services to their legions of followers. But how to ensure that leaders, partners, providers, business partners and other influencers are always faithful to the organization's truth. What's more, do these followers verify the source and veracity of their influencers. In an environment where there is a decentralization of news authorship, where fake news, fake news, are revealed all the time. How should companies act to overcome the challenges of having their brand denigrated. How should companies act to ensure transparency within organizations and promote open discussions, on platforms, without fake news becoming a problem.

In the formation of strategic alliances for the digital transformation by companies, it is necessary not only to look for brands, or years in the market, but to evaluate aspects of a real digital organization, which has adequate management of its resources and people, and that they align with the organization's purposes, not with something merely commercial. Or that they just use an image or brand, but don't actually practice what they preach. It is important for companies when making their choices to choose partners that:
- Valuing Consultants and Startups: Consultants with expertise and Startups with products and services, are easier to relate to and strengthen a more exclusive and dedicated relationship, with much more approximation.
- Assessing Supplier Data Customers: Consulting and having conversations with customers of a given supplier will give you a better perspective on strengths and weaknesses.
- Defining whether the relationship is not merely transactional: Understanding what will be developed and the pricing of contracts can say a lot about the future partner's interest. As well as evaluating the existence and authenticity of resources available and that have effective experience. Some suppliers sell proposals without even having the resources with the necessary skills and capabilities, and most importantly, aligned with the purpose and culture of the institution.
- Risk Sharing: Is this supplier entering a business model in which it is part of its bottom line? How many clauses does he have that allow him to exempt himself from certain commitments that impact the effective delivery of his service?

So how do leaders in the corporate world deal with an environment where “fake news” is allowed to thrive? Leaders must promote a culture of truthfulness, responsibility and common sense. This makes encouraging a culture based on transparency, and quick action to work around messaging issues across the market, crucial for business leaders. In this culture, people are grateful for honesty, transparency, hard work, teamwork, and the kind of relationship that results from those actions. In addition, the wisdom necessary to fight the temptation to lie to ourselves and others is developed whenever we face challenging circumstances and goals.

In such an environment, professionals are also more likely to develop essential managerial skills such as fact checking, obtaining evidence, reasoning logically and with common sense, all related to high performance, brand equity and consumer loyalty.
