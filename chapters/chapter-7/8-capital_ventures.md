# Capital ventures

>"Corporate venture capital (CVC) is an alternative way for companies to accelerate their digital transformation journey by investing in nascent and emerging companies. The CVC model has created a new dynamic in the investment ecosystem, stimulating innovation and creating a good strategy for companies that want to learn about new technologies, practices, and methods. Investing in CVC can help increase R&D efforts and integration, amplify innovation within the core, and create opportunities for future partnerships. CVC also provides a way to protect intellectual property and maintain an intimate relationship with the company."

>In the sitcom “Silicon Valley”, Richard Hendricks is a shy but super smart programmer. He created a revolutionary data compression algorithm, which being used on the Internet, would allow streaming with much higher quality. Several investors approached him, he went in and out of several deals, went broke, and today he has a new solution to enter the market.

In today's digital economy, in many cases, inward investment and merger activity are simply not enough to drive growth for companies that need to stay competitive. As an increasingly growing alternative, the corporate venture capital (CVC) model, although not new, has created a new dynamic in the investment ecosystem and the stimulus to innovation, as well as a good strategy for companies that want to accelerate their entry into the process of learning technologies, practices and methods for your digital transformation journey. If you didn't already know, although the scope of CVC is in nascent and emerging companies, the venture capital sector has helped create cases such as Apple, Intel, FedEx, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Compaq Computer. Each of these companies received funding from venture capital funds early in their development and later became publicly traded companies. Advanced companies such as Intel, Google and GE are demonstrating the practical benefits of CVCs to fuel their innovation engine.
In practice, investing in this type of initiative can allow an increase in R&D efforts and integration. While many companies seek to choose partners with the best chance of “guaranteed” success, others go further and look for partners who are able to detect new opportunities for disruption, far from the “mainstream”. This is especially true of early stage investments, which provide a way to amplify innovation within the core, but also into adjacent markets and opportunities.

The most obvious benefit is a close linkage to the potential acquisition target, preventing other competitors from benefiting from this new partner's initiatives. Not only an investment in protecting intellectual property, but also as maintaining the intimate relationship with the company.

How to formalize investments in companies that are not close to our business, but that have great potential to drive the market and generate innovations? What is known is that companies that open their investments beyond their operating segment gain market recognition and a lot of competitive intelligence generated by contact with other forms of management. There are some moments when companies can look for and identify other businesses where there is an opportunity for approximation and synergy. In this case, the investee does not necessarily have a product that is close to or complementary to its core business. The investment can be given by the potential presented by the company and by the level of learning and exchange that is believed to be generated with the investee company. Thus, a capital contribution is made to assist in the maturation of the company for a possible approach or definitive partnership.

In countless strategies to pave fertile ground for the generation of innovations, we cannot only restrict ourselves to what we can produce within the organization, or bringing and listing partners, but also contributing and betting on new organizations that in the future can yield not only innovation synergies and efficiency to your organization, but also how to generate great financial results and new customers, or "cross-sell" with customers in your portfolio.
