>In the "The Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy, Gandalf leads The Fellowship of the Ring to have Frodo throw the ring into the volcano of Mount Doom in order to destroy Mordor and the evil empire once and for all. On this journey, many stories are told about the races and species of Middle-earth, uniting them to a common purpose, and forming a bond of lasting friendship.

Digital transformation by itself is already a great challenge for any organization, but this challenge cannot take technology as the only guide in this process, as it will lead to a possible failure and moral shake in the organization, since the meaning and purpose of the transformation do not they are based on consistency, common sense and good practices in terms of understanding the real problem of the customer or business.

Digital transformation is an action that is completely dependent on a very well-crafted mapping of the current problems and strategies identified. And these problems need to be evaluated from the perspective of innovation, experiences, talents, businesses and markets, which need to be designed and structured as challenges, employing the participation of different areas, knowledge, experiences, including partners and other providers that surround the given challenges. This organizational model constitutes the prologue of a story to be unfolded by the actors involved in this journey of stories, mobilizing people and their creative and collaborative capacity.

It is necessary to manage these stories in an ongoing process to mature the problems and opportunities, as well as to have tracking and prioritization by the digital transformation committees, which assist the leaders of each group in the formulation of high-impact challenges. From there, these challenges evolve into stories that guide the search and development of more creative and effective solutions. With the engagement of multiple areas, including customers, facilitating the quality of what is produced according to their requirements and success criteria, as well as its adoption by the organization. This story can be a set of processes, business rules, workflows, tools, and principles that provide a practice for identifying areas and opportunities and developing solutions that deliver new user experiences. It is not enough just to have ideas or a collaborative environment and workflow tools, it is necessary to unite these proposals into a relevant story to pave a clear path for the evolution, learning and implementation of the solutions that form digital competences and capabilities. The goal is that these challenges, having their transdisciplinary teams created on demand, can capture conversations and collaboration where they effectively occur, in any unstructured environment, centering all activity around challenge statements following a human and democratic narrative, so that their content engage and be easily understood by everyone.

The motivation for these challenges is based on reward and recognition systems that must be designed to involve individuals who are part of the journey, which must have a specific reward system for each community defined in this storyline.

The portfolio of these challenges must also have expressed their investment values and time to completion, establishing the speed, expectations and sense of urgency, as well as promoting the maturity of the teams in terms of the commercial value of their work produced. Also exit strategies, such as greater investment or subsequent steps that need to be defined, or even abandoning the challenge at certain stages where changes or discoveries may invalidate the challenge, or its revision.

The definition of the challenge needs to follow OKR (Objective Key Results) and SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) concepts, having a leader and representative of this group whose mission is to promote, measure engagement, delimit participation from other areas, partners and customers, creating a sense of community and producing results.

These challenges also have their record and progress in a natural way and integrated with day-to-day activities, and are supported by the history that is being produced, which can be linked through photographic records, videos, blogs, comments, meetings, logs. decision making, thus resulting in a base of experience and knowledge that is visible and accessible throughout the organization.
