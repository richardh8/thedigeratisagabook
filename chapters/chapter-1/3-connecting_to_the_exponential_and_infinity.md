# Connecting to the exponential and infinity

>"To transform the world, which is to transform your social problem impacting people in the society, thinking counter intuitively is key to build the cornerstone of your research, salted with many and fast experimentations which will form your DNA in digital solutions to those problems in ways which no other technology organization would consider."

>In the movie "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", Arthur Dent discovers that his home and planet Earth will be destroyed in minutes, but meets the Ford Prefect who saves him, and shows him the proportions of life in the galaxy.

Several organizations from different industries are being disrupted by indirect competitors, who mostly employ new technologies, consumer experiences and business models, and only realize this disruption when the fact has occurred, depriving them of time to rethink their business and strategy, with no room for manoeuvre. One of the main causes is in the mental model in practice by these organizations, which follow linear projections of forecast, action and goals, as well as the disconnection between market, customers, suppliers and partners, leading to excessive verticalization, and creating entropy and limitation of capabilities for innovation. Even with opening actions, organizations are faced with the reaction of an immune system that counterattacks actions that seek change. A resistance that is based on unpreparedness, insecurity and mistrust. This fact has strong links to human psychology, a reaction in the amygdala in our brains, triggering negative reactions linked to threat.

Leaders need to create their own rupture and aim for a transformation in their thinking model, and doing this with the same people will not bring the desired effects, since time and paradigms do not change easily. People are influenced by each other in their day-to-day, and to bring about changes in behavior and attitudes, it is necessary to have new minds interacting in the DNA of the organization. This requires organizations to be comfortable finding and developing new types of partnerships and collaborations. New relationships are key to developing depth and exposure to exponential technologies, as well as innovating and executing digital transformation at the pace required.

Being intimate with exponential technology partners, embracing their transformational impact means creating new competencies. Increasing organizational agility, strengthening infinite learning capabilities, evolving learning networks, talents, leveraging gamification, new metrics and building new relationships that enhance and strengthen the ecosystem.

An opening needs to be humble, and it cannot be contaminated with vices and bilateral interests, nor in the pursuit of undue advantages. It is an openness to listen, understand different perspectives, approaches and results, nourished by an incessant search for the formation of altruistic values, aiming at the benefit of society, impacting millions of people. It is an introspective process that connects the best produced by the organization, such as its knowledge and experiences, connecting to a new level of purposes and principles, aiming at transparency, frankness, realism and diversity of opinions.

The construction of this opening will develop exponential purposes that need to be evaluated and bring the engagement of strategic partners that will nurture, support, integrate and maintain these purposes at the ecosystem level, a symbiosis in demand and supply chain where all parties win. And to grow and evolve in this ecosystem, it is necessary to evaluate partners that have a massive transformative purpose, fully scalable and with a range of plurality of ideas. Scale in the sense of being able to absorb exponential demands, as well as being able to supply in the same proportion to meet the exponential demand of the final organization in the chain. Also being able to create a sense of belonging in a community that relies on the power of crowds to have insights, validations and delivery of solutions, using algorithms, and leveraging its best values.

To avoid rupture, it is necessary to break the taboos of an organization and to embrace this purpose, creating an evolution from the current culture to a new one that is in line with the exponential culture.
