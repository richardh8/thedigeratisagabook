# Focusing on new experiences

>"There might be so many innovations relying on market problems out there, however what you build from an end user in combination with your value proposition, can make a sole difference, empathy, neural sciences, prototyping and digital accumen are key to outperform failures"

The user experience factor has become the new business strategy for organizations, as it is the ultimate catalyst and loyalist in the success of a brand. It is not enough to have excellence in delivering the value of the proposal, or a good interface solution for the service to grow exponentially and gain an unfair advantage over the competition. We have to understand that the experience is the experience of interactions in different user contexts, this encompasses functionality, utility, impact, values and principles, price, relationship, communication and consumer maintenance, constituting a unique feeling about the brand, which needs provide positive experiences, supporting, anticipating and delighting the user. E To survive the future, it is necessary to more than comply with functionality, it is necessary to develop new experiences with the consumer, it is the kind of innovation that creates a purpose of relevance and impact that justifies the beginning of a digital transformation, which will deliver the capabilities needed to support the new journeys that will realize this new user experience. For this, the redesign of the thinking model in the organization must turn to the user experience with full force, as this factor will naturally bring the elements and appropriate directions to address real problems through new experiences, bringing real innovation.

New user experiences are quickly noticed by the market; attracting investors and consumers, as well as talent and technology employment, and we are already seeing many cases of great economic and financial results in various sectors of the industry. And this leads us to reconsider strategies on how to address today's problems and how to position investment in organizations. Investing in new experiences is related to increasing your competitiveness and survival, allowing you to be much less exposed to a possible disruption.

This search for new experiences arises from researching and evaluating existing experience problems in solutions, as well as evaluating the competition or looking at experiences from other sectors. The issue is to create a user-oriented culture in an intrinsic way, strongly connected to their activities and interactions with the services. User interactions also go through the organization's culture, he is informed of the purposes and work model of the brand. Understanding the journey they go through, and understanding the points of negative or neutral assessment, is the source of the real problem, which can be in utility, policies, processes, norms, deadlines, noise, interruptions, etc. Questions such as what is meant by a successful workday, what happens so that the user feels empowered to carry out tasks in super-productive ways, are fundamental points for introspection and creating new experiences. Loyalty is linked to the motivation of a sense of accomplishment, of greater competence. The question posed in the opposite way is also valuable, such as what kinds of things make the user feel unproductive, and thinking beyond the solution and about the problem people have, is also a way for innovative experiences to arise.

Once the opportunities brought by new experiences are detected, it is essential to carry out conceptual tests with existing users and new users to quickly collect comments and suggestions, as well as start the co-creative process in the design of solution proposals, and this is not only the responsibility of the service , but how to learn, buy, consume, and how will this experience evolve in the future. The conceptualization and definition process cannot open spaces for investment risks and losses that can only be detected after the delivery of the experience, so the participation of the user community is of paramount importance, as well as revealing greater realism and expansion of details that can add or disaggregate value to the end-to-end experience.
