>In the movie "The Expendables", Barney Ross is an ex-combatant of the American Special Air Service, who knows several agents well and has them as friends. They join any parade Barney organizes, they know the value and purpose of the mission, and they are all united by trust, friendship and a taste for guns. There are no pirates, gangsters and mobsters to stop them.

"No matter how powerful you become, never try to do it alone, or you will fail." This common phrase in anime currently expresses digital organizations very well. We are living in a moment where the concept of collaboration is going to unthinkable heights. The power of collaboration is being one of the great catalysts of innovation and disruption in the market. And these disruptions are happening with increasing frequency.

Leaders of digital transformation journeys are being challenged to create and nurture digital ecosystems that involve customers, employees, suppliers or even similar business networks. Partners become customers, competitors become partners, and suppliers act as customers.

Digital ecosystems are communities that use scalable shareable resources to achieve challenging goals and common interests. Digital ecosystems are key to disrupting markets and effectively competing in our current highly connected digital world. Through platforms that make shared resources available, such as software, data and computing resources, ecosystems help organizations deliver high value-added products and services with great speed and efficiency. Ecosystem is about creating value. Ecosystems allow businesses to learn all the time and identify market opportunities that no one understands as possible.

But how to consider aspects of ecosystems in a digital transformation strategy? As part of the answer, it can be said that considering aspects of ecosystems is essential, or rather, vital. Below are some of the aspects to consider:

Create Partnerships to Accelerate Growth: Organizations have traditionally brought new products and services to market in a highly planned manner. This systematic strategy does not hold up in today's much more dynamic market where offers become obsolete and commoditized very quickly. Today organizations must be much more fluid, adaptable and always ready to change. Good partnerships that build ecosystems add a lot, bringing unique capabilities.

Use cloud resources to build relationships and enable continuous change: Migration of technological resources to the cloud is always thought of because of its lower cost. Everyone agrees that this is a great argument and will always be the starting point. However, the potential of having your systems running there, where customers, suppliers and partners can easily integrate without the restrictions of the on-premises world should never be overlooked.

An organization does not belong to a single ecosystem: leaders often think of ecosystems as something their core business model should be aligned and connected to. The topic of ecosystems is much broader than that. An organization must be connected to diverse ecosystems. Even the most unlikely ones, which may have little or nothing to do with your main business. Innovations and ruptures always come from the improbable.

So, always think about leveraging ecosystems in your favor and purpose. By doing this, you will always be getting a good deal.
