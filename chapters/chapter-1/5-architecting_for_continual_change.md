# Architecting for Continual Change

>"Design, socialize, deploy, do all over again, establishing architecture across the organization, software development, deployment is an ongoing aspiration on how to make changes easier, with a short-span of time. Architecture Is more about your organizational productivity, with embedded quality, security, performance, resilience and scalability."

Wounds and other damage heal at a relatively fast rate, and she is resistant to poisons. As well as regrowing severed limbs and recovering from fatal injuries.

Organizations undergoing digital transformation have demonstrated increased market share, customer engagement, employee morale, productivity and revenue. However, there are major challenges for organizations that want to embark on this journey. And one of them is the great ability to change and adapt, and continue in this process for many years, a requirement of digital transformation, known as “digital-continuum”.

In a survey of organizations undergoing digital transformation, a simple question was asked. “What are the main challenges your organization is facing during the digital transformation?”. Surprisingly, the responses obtained, regardless of the segment and size of the organization, are quite similar. And all the challenges are related to the ability of organizations to change. And this ability is not restricted to a single aspect. Here are the main ones:

People's Resistance: By their very nature, humans like routines. Routines make people feel comfortable. Everyone, without exception, feels unstable and uncomfortable when the new appears. And embarking on a journey of digital transformation will have the “new” as constant. And the best way to deal with resistance from people can be summed up in two words: purpose and transparency. Purpose to engage people in change, insert them in the process and give them a greater value than their current comfort; and transparency to keep them on the right path, even if that path is tortuous and without a clear destination. What is being done is transforming the culture of the organization to allow for experimentation, learning and continuous change driven by technology.

Scope of Digital Transformation Strategy: Let's be clear, a strategy is needed. It is vital to have a vision, goals and a purpose. And it is essential that the strategy to be defined has full coverage. It should cover the entire organization and not just one function or department. It is common to see organizations creating “the innovation department”. The success rate of this type of initiative is quite low. We must remember that a digital transformation requires the organization to change and not for a small part of it to try to change. If only a part of the organization tries to change, the “organisation's immune system” will fight against this attempt, discouraging and making the initiative unfeasible.

Expertise to lead a digital transformation: Take the combination of talent and technology. One without the other is not capable of generating an effective digital transformation. If the technology used by an organization delays change, now is the time to re-evaluate partners. Technical challenges will be a constant in a digital transformation, so it will be necessary to train teams in the understanding and application of technologies.

The current organization structure: A digital transformation does not only change the routines of employees and processes. It requires constant changes in roles, functions and departments. And often, across the organization. A new organizational structure must be fluid. And the new frontiers of technology, data and customer experience will demand it.

Manage your budget and investment capacity: Wouldn't it be great to have a fund of unlimited resources to drive a digital transformation journey? But this is not the reality anywhere. Digital Transformation requires preparation. It is not, and should never be, an irresponsible journey. And it requires a substantial investment. But it must be remembered that it is not a race. You must take into account the power of investment and structure a journey over several years for success and returns. The organization should never be put at financial risk.

A successful digital organization must be architected for change, it must have a culture and mentality adapted to the new reality of the digital world, which undergoes sudden changes all the time. An organization defined in this way enables the construction of a versatile and agile technological architecture, capable of giving quick responses and introducing new technologies and platforms with zero resistance, allowing the rapid exploration, modeling and adoption of new businesses and services, on an ongoing basis.
