Innovating mentally and visualizing your organization and functioning years ahead is easy. For this, it is enough to sit in a comfortable place, reflect on the problems and business opportunities and then visualize how the organization should operate to solve the problems and make the most of the opportunities identified. However, real life is not so simple. Solving problems mentally is just a first step. After a vision has been envisioned, discussed, and refined; it must be put to the test, in the real world, in a real organization, with real people. And this is where many fantastic visions of a perfect organization fade away. It's like an old saying, which is more current than ever. “Hell is full of good ideas”. Innovative products designed in isolation do not take into account the response and feeling of their consumers. Idealized internal operations do not take into account people's ability to change, think differently and operate differently. Perfect organizational structures in the imagination do not take into account the human aspect of everyone involved, their dreams and aspirations, their capabilities and attachments. Thus, everything that is imagined must somehow be put into practice in the real world so that the reactions of the people involved can be understood and the vision can be adjusted to these reactions, in a fluid and continuous way.

It is common to think about solutions to everyday problems. And it is also common, in moments when we are relaxed, with the mind a little empty, to have insights from radical ideas. That idea that brings us the thought “I solved my life! This idea is worth millions!”. And then comes the impetus to talk to the team and put these ideas into practice as quickly as possible, before others come up with similar ideas.

But, how to put into practice both continuous improvements and radical innovations? And how is it possible to reconcile the constant evolution of processes, services and products with an innovative and sometimes disruptive vision?

The organization as a large and single flow consisting of several projects

What if your organization was always prepared for continuous evolution? Working on parallel fronts, such as an investment portfolio, following its flow and processes best suited to the type of initiative. What if the people in your organization were always ready to continually improve what they do? Well, this is a very important part of a digital transformation.

It is a radical change in the paradigm of the people who form an organization. They must face the challenge of running an operation in a stable and productive way, while continually questioning and improving that same operation, in tune with disruptive innovations that can come and radically change those same operations. They must be open to testing new ideas. Sometimes those ideas that come in the shower. And they must be continually open to evolution and transformation. They must live these evolutions continuously, as if the entire organization were a single, large stream of demands that continually deliver improvements and disruptions.
