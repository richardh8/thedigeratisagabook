# Sense of belonging

>"In "Dances With Wolves," loyalty comes from purpose. Creating a sense of belonging for customers is more effective than reward programs. Understanding trends in movements and causes is necessary to align with clients' beliefs, while beautiful experiences must deliver personalization and relevance. In the digital era, touchpoints need to be immediate, relevant, and personalized. Modeling moments of truth can adapt functions and content to different user contexts, while inviting users to pilot new versions allows for feedback on design and context."

|Loyalty will come from your purpose|

>In the movie "Dances With Wolves", John Dumber is an officer in the American army, with a mission to remove at all costs the indigenous people, known as the Sioux, from the west region. He abandons his career to become a Sioux.

Working on pricing, advantages and other benefits around a program for customers will only last for a while, and will consume resources and reduce your profit margin, not to mention the low effectiveness of these programs, as they are poorly adapted to the needs of its customers, working more like a chain of partners where everyone wins, and the customer has their options restricted, even not using the benefit.

The great differential for loyalty is to have a service originated by the spontaneous desire of the user, to identify with a given group of people and personalities, which are aligned in their purpose of value that is constantly expressed, maintained and idealized, as a movement or a cause. This phenomenon comes as a result of awareness, changes in behavior, attitudes, even new sciences and knowledge that did not exist before. And this phenomenon of movements and causes is dynamic and we must constantly understand the trends of the movements and how to create objects of desire that combine the forces of this movement at its service as a purpose, the reason for the existence of this value proposition.

The services provided also need to deliver beautiful experiences that are expressed in the intelligence employed, in the relevance of the context and visual aesthetics. But to understand the connectivity and relationship of other common daily services around the client, such as their interests, their beliefs and their network of relationships, leading to more information and data, personalizing and at the same time working the purposes in line with the philosophies of your client. .

With the Internet of Things (Any device connected to the Internet) a series of user actions now have remote controls, allowing to perform, control and manage practically everything, from relationships to financial transactions. Expectations are extremely high and competition is fierce. If customers' needs or expectations aren't met, they're likely to go out and find other options with a single tap — or more appropriately in the keyboard-free era, a snap.

Engage and inspire the user experience across all channels, physical and digital, offering products and services of unprecedented attraction and reach. Incredibly crafted digital convergence — where technology becomes seductive — is a key priority on Digital Transformation agendas. This means designing a coherent experience across all channels and relationships around each individual customer, creating a true experience to be desired.

Digital touchpoints need to demonstrate immediate value, prioritize core functionality, and dynamically organize content, so user context is relevant. In a relevant user experience, we must meet immediate needs in a personalized way.

Defining the why, what, how much and when is a fundamental part of the design for the presentation of information and functionality to each user. Modeling moments of truth provides criteria that adapt functions and contents depending on a given user context, which will be delighted and very productive. Continuously and actively evaluating and analyzing user comments are also parallel contexts to be examined, responded to and addressed in the solution. As well as inviting them to pilot new versions, such as target groups using prototypes based on the “Minimum Viable Product” scope, allowing for user validation of intelligence, context relevance and design employed.
