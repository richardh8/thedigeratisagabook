>"The movie "Now You See Me" inspires the concept of observing customers' day-to-day experiences as a way to understand and design better user experiences.

It is important to observe customers in their environment, without interfering in their experiences, and validate the data collected through open-ended questions.

|Observing the reality of your real customer|

>In the movie “Now you see me”, the Four Horsemen perform their magic tricks in the street in front of crowds, delighting customers with new experiences. Nothing to hide but his tricks, staring at customers directly.

The guiding compass and guide for digital transformation is the constant search for the newest and most innovative user experience, it is this inspiring formula that needs to take shape quickly because without the organization's understanding of its value proposition as an enchanting user experience, no advance to apply technological innovation, business models and other leadership practices. And in this challenge, leaving your room, office, organization and even distancing yourself from the company's culture and people, including your own mind that is full of opinions and ideas, is essential to confront the reality of your real customer. For this, the company must create a more permissive culture so that certain employees responsible for ideation, products, support and marketing, go out into the street to disconnect from daily and everyday activities and seek the environment where their customers are. Whether physically or virtually, experiencing what the customer lives is where the real situations that customers experience with services and products are found. And it is your concrete argument for decision-making in relation to your digital transformation.

The concept is to be able to observe clients in their day-to-day as a detective, not secret, since the client must be approached a posteriori, but the question of observation in “natura”, is to be able to observe without interfering in the process and in the experience, as an initial approach to this observation, creates distortions as the client is aware of the observation, and will have different behaviors and attitudes. So, observe how he arrives at the environment, how he observes things, how he dresses and behaves, how he touches and observes, what expressions this customer has in this environment, with the cashier, the information, the price, what he is evaluating, and what other competing and similar products it is also considering. In the virtual environment, what are people commenting, what are the reactions to these comments, through social networks, complaint sites, the search and to which pages your customers are going, as well as the customer navigates, where the mouse or fingers pass? What does your website analytics data point to? In addition to looking at interactions with your services, you should also look at the adjacencies of your value proposition, what is the customer doing to complement your service? How did he acquire, pay for this service, what other services is he adding to achieve what he seeks to carry out his tasks and activities? Often the value of the proposal is incomplete in its full applicability on the part of the user, having to use adjacent services and contents to form their solution. We have a tendency to think of products to provide solutions to specific problems, but we have to have a good understanding of what the customer wants to achieve, and we have to see it in a comprehensive and expanded way, and that treats the user experience in its entirety. Without this understanding, we can have a limited perception, or even abandonment of the purchase of your service by the customer. Understanding who your customers are, what their economic situation is like, why they seek this service, payment methods, prices, help to design the experience as a whole, from awareness, decision and purchase. Pricing is subjective, and depends on these factors, as well as the model of payment methods, frequencies, advantages and aggregating valuesuch as long-term discounts, or indications from other customers, the experience has to understand the entire cycle.

After collecting this qualitative information, without any evaluation, just paying attention to the points of how the customer felt in each interaction with the service, then you can approach this customer, introduce yourself and do a brief interview to validate the data captured through of open-ended questions, and allowing the client to tell his own version of the story, why that need arose, what he seeks to do and accomplish, what results he expects to have and how he perceives the value of it. With this information, you have the zero vector to guide your digital transformation in a reputable way, really focused on the customer.
