# New experiences as business opportunities

>"The success of innovative companies is not due solely to technology, good management or business models, but rather to the creation of new experiences that were not previously thought possible. Companies that invest in new user experiences are more attractive to investors, consumers and talent, and have a greater chance of surviving in a competitive market. Therefore, organizations should focus on developing new experiences for their customers, as this is the real competitive advantage that will bring long-term success. Redesigning the organization's thinking model towards UX with full force will bring innovation and attract necessary investments for digital transformation."

>In the series “Mr Selfridge”, Harry Gordon Selfridge undertakes the construction of the largest department store in England from scratch, where his focus is completely centered on the customer, and creating a new shopping experience for him.

The digital experience greatly increased people's reality, and enabled a wide range of experiences that could never have been produced without digital technologies. We can observe how many innovative companies allowed the creation of these new experiences on a global level and that today lead the investment and capitalization rankings, and on the other hand we see so many other companies already consolidated in the market with little attractiveness for investors. In some cases, they have little appeal even to consumers and users. But what is behind all this? We might think that it would be technology, an innovative business model, good management, etc. In fact, what these companies are delivering are simply new experiences that no one thought possible. And the rhythm is incessant, every day we have a new experience being developed and delivered to the market on a global scale. These companies are receiving stratospheric injections of capital. It is these organizations that are attracting the best talent, they are the ones that are driving high consumer expectations and investment, they are the ones that are consuming purposeful and meaningful technology and new user experiences. And this leads us to reconsider strategies on how to address today's problems and how to position UX investment in our organizations. New user experiences are perceived with great relevance by the market; as investors and consumers; a large volume of capital is attracted to these companies, even without even wanting to have the final product or service; as well as talents are strongly attracted to these organizations. Not to mention the great economic and financial results of these companies.

So, continuing to invest in UX to get a good experience can be considered a waste of time and money. However, investing directly in new experiences is related to increasing your competitiveness and survival, allowing you to be much less exposed to a possible rupture.

Your digital transformation will only be viable and useful when successfully pivoted, employed with its proper purpose to support a new user experience. Focus your energy and investment on developing the new experience for your customer. The real competitive advantage is in this new user experience. It's not your new niche or market segment, nor your new business model alone that will bring results. We have to understand that experience is the experience of interactions in different contexts of the user, this encompasses functionality, usefulness, impact, values and principles, price, relationship, communication and maintenance of this user. Having a good interface solution in your product is not enough for your service to grow exponentially and create an unfair advantage over the competition.

Excellence in delivering the proposed value is not enough either, its excellence will not last for long. To survive the future requires new experiences and the frequent maintenance of these new experiences.

For this, the redesign of the thinking model in the organization must turn to UX with full force, as UX will naturally bring the elements of Design Thinking to an adequate purpose and direction in addressing problems through new experiences, bringing true innovation.

Only then will it be able to attract the necessary investments so that, subsequently, a digital transformation can be initiated that can deliver the necessary capabilities to support the new journeys that will materialize this new user experience.
