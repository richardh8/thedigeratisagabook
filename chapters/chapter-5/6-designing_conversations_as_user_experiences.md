# Designing conversations as user experiences

>"In the movie "Man of Steel", Clark Kent has superpowers, and a customer and employee-centric organization uses design combined with user experience to guide all decisions. The focus is on delivering positive and highly productive experiences that empower users and maximize efficiency, with real digital companies producing results while minimizing resources. Consumers expect automatic reconfiguration of services that adapt to their context, and smart brands will do just that to keep up with changing needs."

>In the movie "Man of Steel", Clark Kent has his super-augmented reality on planet Earth, even allowing him to defy gravity and have powerful forces.

A customer and employee-centric organization uses design combined with user experience to guide all decisions about the journeys and processes which will shape the interactions of its customers and employees with different systems and applications. And for that, it is necessary to understand what is in fact fundamental and essential in these interactions, emotional attachment and empowerment. Therefore the design must get into the trenches fo the interactions between people and with interfaces, as well as systems interfaces with other systems, and B2B (Business to Business) or A2A (Application to Application) interfaces, because the result of the customer experience is a flawless execution of all the ecosystem which composes the process at happy, alternative, excepcional or failure paths. One of the most important elements is how to bring an experience that generates positive and highly productive feelings to customers, that is, how the solution design of the interface promotes augmentation of the reality for its users in a human way, considering ubiquity and leverage the capabilities and apps available at their device. Also, not only the experience with the interfaces, but with a desirable, viable and feasible product, that is, how to make a user a super hero from a productivity and value points, and no longer make an user, an expert in the use of such a tool and process. It is no wonder that digital transformation imposes so many challenges in the paradigms of designing interface solution such as Web-browser, Mobile App, APIs, etc. After all, you might think, just digitize the current processes, papers and signatures collections, and we will have a complete digital transformation. No, that is not the purpose of digital transformation, these actions refer to a digitization process, and not a digital transformation. A premise of digital transformation is to empower human capital to its maximum productive capacity through digital capabilities, which is a relative and temporary capacity, since the user will always demand more advances, therefore this capacity will continuously increase efficiency in order to eliminate waste, hassle points, extra clicks or look around for documentation and paper, as much as possible. The goal is to make more time and energy available to users in the face of the changes and challenges that will come on a day-to-day basis. Real digital companies are the ones that most produce and deliver better experiences through augmented reality features through digital capabilities, versus the number of people necessary to carry over processes to deliver results. Where the maximization result is sought to the detriment of the minimization of resources involved to fulfill execution. And this needs to be applied in all spheres that touch the organization as well as within it, that is, it is not only in the action of customer communication, brand dissemination, marketing and sales campaigns, it is in the consumption of goods and services within the organization. Customers are increasingly aware and less tolerant to mistakes, an error in usage can lead to dropouts or make after-sales renewal cost a lot or not be possible.

Consumers are already on top of expectations, fueled in part by their digital lives of constant service updates and seamless personalization. They expected from all the types of digital products and services and great level of personaliation to chose and match their future ahead, and these worlds are dynamic, so we have to magically get closer to their needs, desires. and whims, and the events of their lives.

Remember, consumers don't need to experiment with the most innovative forms of digital adaptation to reconfigure their expectations. They just need to aware of them. They expect an automatic reconfiguration of services depending on where they are in the journey, how it interacts with the product and service, its consumption including its pricing. The expectation from now on is that services adapt to the context given by the customer through their interactions and generated data, a demand for the use of intelligence and automation on a large scale but personalized for each one, is a must. A design that aligns user experiences with business, design for indulgent offers that adapt to changing needs before your customer switches to a competitor. We can see this trend already happening, where smart brands will do just that. Even if it means creating products and services that seem to defy the laws of space and time. Ready, adjust, adapt!
