Collaboration isn't about being best friends, or even liking everyone you work with. It's about bringing your best to work and focusing on a common goal. Ideas are not enough to achieve a goal. Collaboration is necessary to turn ideas into reality. No one can achieve great goals alone. Collaboration is not about giving up your individuality. Quite the contrary, it's about realizing your potential. It's about bringing your skills and experiences and sharing them in pursuit of a common goal. It's about bringing your ideas, your passion, your mind, heart and soul to work.
Key questions about collaboration in digital transformation

Do employees have a clear vision of their common goals?

Without common goals, even if they want to, people cannot collaborate. In a digital transformation strategy, everyone involved must be aligned with the goals and everyone must achieve them together.

Do compensation plans encourage selfish or altruistic, collaborative or competitive attitudes?

Compensation plans that focus on individual performance encourage competition among employees, but reduce the chances of collaborating to identify and explore new forms of business.

Compensation plans that focus on team performance tend to level everyone out, reducing the engagement of more capable employees, but increase the chance that new forms of business can be identified and explored.

Can Collaboration Technologies Boost Productivity?

The use of collaboration technologies has been changing the behavior of teams that were previously considered highly competitive such as sales. These teams achieve better performance through collaboration in identifying new markets, ways of doing business and more personalized offers. And this is one of the important aspects in a digital transformation strategy.

Do competitive environments guarantee satisfaction?

Remuneration for work is considered immediate compensation. Competition may be the best way to secure higher pay. However, most people are also interested in other, longer-term rewards, such as knowledge, career advancement, and recognition from peers and leaders.

Can compensation only be won through competition?

Open source technology projects have attracted millions of programmers from all corners of the world for 2 decades to collaborate, without earning a single penny for their contribution. What are the incentives for these people to make their contribution to the world? Studies have shown that the vast majority of these employees want recognition from their peers and the community and gain knowledge and experience to advance their professional careers. And open source projects give them just that.
