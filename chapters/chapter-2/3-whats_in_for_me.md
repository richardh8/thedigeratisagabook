To win in the market, the organization must first win in the work environment, engagement is fundamental in activating high-performance teams. The financial rewards need to be attractive and consistent with local market conditions, but they will not be enough to have and retain brilliant and engaged professionals in an organization. Even more so when this organization is challenged with the implementation of digital transformation. In addition to a good salary, the meaning, purpose, opportunities for growth and professional development must be considered and something very important is the opportunity to express, drive and implement your ideas. In other words, in addition to the sense of integrity, justice and opportunity for development, we should not restrict ourselves to learning only, we should also explore ideas and solution proposals. People seek career opportunities where they can contribute to the company's purposes and strategies, while maintaining adequate autonomy, support and support.

Rewards reflect status and access to resources, both of which support personal achievement. Working in decent conditions is essential. And what people want, in addition to a fair salary, is work with meaning and rewards according to their resourcefulness, collaboration, daily practice of good posture and alignment with the culture and strategies established by the organization.

Good management of human capital is vital. People value good management. Good managers come at a cost, but they are very effective in dealing with people. Employees join organizations because they feel that their values align with the organization's. Employees leave organizations because they feel that their direct managers are not aligned with these same values. Freedom and autonomy are important, as all of us humans value freedom, which can be logistical freedom or intellectual freedom. Since logistical freedom allows people to plan their time (their most precious asset) the way they want. While intellectual freedom allows people to think about their activities freely, seeking to improve them for their benefit, as personal fulfillment and for the benefit of the organization.
engagement is

    An emotional commitment the employee has to the organization and its goals rather than happiness or satisfaction;
    Having employees care about their work and their company. They don't work just for the olerite or just for the next promotion, but on behalf of the organization's goals.

The value of employee engagement

    When employees care—when they are engaged—they use voluntary effort in carrying out their activities;
    People will work overtime when needed, without being asked. They will be altruistic with their co-workers, cleaning, consumption and organization of physical space;
    Will go beyond their contractual obligations when necessary, acting and contributing to results;
    They bring better results, in fact more than 6% profit on margins, and present 5 times more return to their investors over the 5-year average;
    Higher service quality and productivity leads to better customer satisfaction, which leads to more sales, higher profits and higher dividends.
