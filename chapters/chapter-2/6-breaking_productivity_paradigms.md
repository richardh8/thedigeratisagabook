>In the series “The Office”, Michael Scott is a regional manager for a paper distributor. He is a failure in the management model, believing that his leadership posture is full of prestige, while in reality, in the minds of his employees, it is not. The lack of management is crucial to the performance of the organization, which has employees who are not engaged and do not know what they are actually doing there.

Organizations have been evolving since the First Industrial Age, employing technology and management practices in the search for rationalization of processes, in search of high productivity to have more products and services suited to market demands, and with a reduction in costs. The combination of these factors has established paradigms that are difficult to replace, even when the main management schools like Harvard change their attitude towards what has been preached so much in business administration around the world.

In the first instance, we had the definitions of the organization of people, in areas and departments, being highly specialized, which led to the isolation of everything, where the only glue is the financial result. Followed by task management, adding specialization within departments, with interfaces between these activities to be monitored and managed by project managers. Then comes time management, ensuring that all the time allotted was efficient and allowed for increased productivity. Soon after, we have the priorities, seeking to make the organization more effective, choosing which actions, and in what order, according to all the factors mentioned above. And for today's reality, with so many emails, feeds, news and changes, managing mental clarity becomes a challenge for the human mind. This does not mean that today we have an adequate mastery of all these management practices, in fact it is rare for organizations to honestly say that they act in 100% of these practices with a high degree of competence and results. But who said that the world stops to wait for us to reach these levels.

The management of our productivity cannot be limited only in our production capacity, if we are not selling anything, if we have changes in policies and regulations, or if we know that the competition is taking our “marketshare”. It doesn't do you any good to be the most productive in the production of a good, if the market ahead sees itself shrinking. Effectiveness is fundamental, but effectiveness has become a more important issue, which is knowing where to act in the midst of so many things to do. And mental energy plays a vital role within the entire productivity chain, because without this energy, the intangible quality of the organization deteriorates, and it is through this mental energy that we extract our creative capacity, of ideation, of being open to seeing things with a different look, such as the customer, an employee and their interactions with the organization's processes. It is creativity that consistently drives the design process, which employs continuous improvement, not only bringing efficiency but also opportunities for innovation. Taking the time to learn new things, interact with different partners and providers, as well as feed on new ideas and technologies, is what allows exponential advances in certain processes of the production chain, instead of focusing on finishing small linear improvements, such as 10% reduction in payroll, 20% increase in sales, etc.

In this digital transformation process, changing people's minds to think about being productive through their mental energy, as a driving force for the creation of solutions allied to the digital capabilities to be inserted, is key to the success of a one-step implementation of this transformation, and without it, you'll end up with yet another technology dusting on the shelf of your organization's assets. The definition, clarity and assertiveness of role definitions is also very important, and they must be designed with purposes, objectives, very well-defined outputs, but also introducing aspects beyond the conventional process, but how to bring improvements and innovations to the organization, they also explore mental energies better, extracting an extra value that is always subdued.

So how to compare the current productivity model and paradigm to this new way of producing? Looking at your organization as a whole, using a set of common staff productivity “KPIs” (“Key Performance Indicators”), for example:

Average Revenue per Employee: Defined as the total revenue divided by the total number of employees, this is an indication of how much revenue the team produces. Improving productivity will increase that number. And you already know that this is strongly linked to innovations inside and outside the organization.

Average Cost per Employee: Defined as total expenses divided by the total number of employees. By decreasing this number, you are incorporating both innovations and efficiencies.

Average Profit per Employee: With profit being the difference between billing and personnel and training expenses, employee productivity can be better understood by themselves, as well as clearly reflected from one period to the next.

Average Compensation per Employee: Employees are paid and, in return, there is an expectation that they provide value to the company in some way.
