|What was a slogan is now the purest reality|

>In the sitcom "Star Trek: The Next Generation", Data is a self-aware and sapient artificial intelligence and synthetic life form. His quest to assimilate aspects of human behavior is inspiring, so much so that his positronic brain was given an emotion chip, allowing him to feel. Data has solutions for everything, using devices and algorithms to solve big problems in the adventures of the crew on the spaceship USS Enterprise-E.

From the inception of digital technologies over 40 years ago to just beyond the year 2000, the tech world was doing well. Innovations and technological novelties were announced at an almost constant pace between cycles of 3 to 5 years. Everyone involved with technology could easily keep up with new trends and news. Year after year, for 30 years, the big tech companies announced their upgrades. It was new hardware for big companies, PCs for small businesses and for personal use. And then there were the “softwares”, which were advertised in specialized magazines and sometimes on TV. And the ads invited customers to visit computer stores to purchase their products. All, whether personal computers or software, were sold in colorful, flashy, and complicated boxes that contained manuals and installation disks. Installation on CDs and DVDs came later, much later.

Not even the advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s changed this reality. Back then, we thought of the Internet only as a more practical way to get information posted by others. The electronic sale of physical products began and we saw the theory of natural selection being applied in full force. Nervous markets and a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with the great innovation of the Internet. However, the pace of innovation continued in the same way, with few innovations that could really take advantage of the potential of the worldwide network and be easily connected to other systems.

Until, on January 9, 2007, a technology company used to working in niche markets presents its new product. It was their first product in the cell phone segment. Apple announces the iPhone. The repercussion was a mixture of excitement and questioning. Specialized magazines saw the product as an innovation, but complained about the speed of communication (EDGE). But, without a doubt, everyone found the product “cute”. It was just another phone, only “fashion”, produced by a “fashion” company, for “fashion” people.

It is not known if, at that time, anyone understood the message given by Steve Jobs, but at that moment one of the most powerful technological ecosystems that we have news emerged. The following year's announcement, on July 11, 2008, along with the launch of the iPhone 3G, incorporated the App Store, which added the possibility of installing third-party applications on the smartphone. Ready! The Ecosystem was created and available.

From that moment on, “software” producers began to conquer this ocean. Continuously, the number of apps (now affectionately called apps) grew. And now, 10 years after those events, all it takes is an idea and a programmer, and you can launch something new on the world market instantly. The more capabilities are added in the smartphone versions, the more creativity is added to the available apps. And it’s important to note that Apple’s vision for this ecosystem has existed since the beginning, so much so that it registered the phrase “there’s an app for that” in 2009.

This model, combined with cloud applications, gave rise to SaaS (Software as a Service), where people and organizations can acquire free or paid access, integrating new digital capabilities into their systems. The “Open APIs” (Application Interfaces Protocol) movement also gained strength, which allows applications and systems to be integrated through the Internet, increasing the capabilities of their services in relation to data, information, content delivery, practically a range of infinite of options.

Today we can say, without a doubt, that there is an app for whatever you need, whether it's the entire application, with its visual layer, controls and models, or through the APIs that can be connected to carry out tasks and transactions . Whether for the protagonist of this innovation, in the case of smartphones, such as the iPhone, or for its powerful competitor Android. And the APIs that are available over the Internet. At this moment, where digital transformation journeys are the subject, everyone should be aware of what already exists in the market, before reinventing the wheel. It may be that an existing app can solve a business problem easily and quickly. Or, it could be that existing apps can be the basis for creating new apps that explore new business opportunities and problem solving. So, always be attentive and with an open mind! There is an app that can solve your problem, learn how to search, test, evaluate and plug in.
