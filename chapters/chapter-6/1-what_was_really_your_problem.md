|Technology without strategy? Strategy without technology?|

>In the series "Lost", 72 survivors of a plane crash are stranded on an island, they don't know where they are and there is no help in sight.

In the recent past, when the adoption of technologies was discussed, it always happened in two moments. In the first, the objective was strictly related to the business strategy. They were executives from the business areas, busy improving revenues, reducing costs or risks to their margins. And at this point, technology was not the agenda in the committees. In a second moment, specialists were involved and the objective was always to adopt technologies to help implement the strategy that had already been defined.

The end result was always: “technology helps us realize our brilliant strategies”.

With the popularization of technologies and major market disruptions caused by the adoption of technologies, several organizations lost business and even closed because they continued to adopt technology in their businesses in this disconnected way.

Nowadays, no one argues that technology will always be a means to achieve big business goals in today's reality. However, the use of technologies is so closely fused with business, that discussions at two different times will be doomed to failure. Technologies should be discussed as part of the business and as an important part of problem solving, business improvement and even as protagonists of major market disruptions. And who doesn't want to be the protagonist in this market of exponential potential?

The result sought today is always: “technology has helped us define brilliant strategies”.

In this way, it is important that the selection and adoption of technologies is in the DNA of organizations, at all levels and domains. And when you ask the question “What was your problem?”, you should answer in a collaborative way, involving all domains of the organization and never forgetting the important role that technologies play in today's world.

Here are some practices and approaches to technology that we should avoid.

Technology areas should avoid treating the other functions of the company as customers: the creation of closed functions of Information Technology, Service Levels, Contracts, Chargeback Strategies and Technology Projects with internal departments isolates the adoption of technologies and only meets the demands already defined, drastically reducing the organization's ability to lead market disruptions.

Treating professionals from other areas as technological idiots: Framing knowledge and experience in technologies within an IT department assumes that professionals from other areas are unfamiliar with technologies. They are usually heavy users of technology, and they can contribute much more than experts realize.

Treat professionals as multitaskers: We know that human beings are better at handling one activity at a time. Thus, creating focused and willing teams will always be better than sharing people between different activities.

Say yes or no to demands: Technology-related functions that work in isolation from the business are usually involved in the moment when they can only answer “Yes, I have the capacity to serve you” or “No, I don’t have the capacity or time to serve you” . The correct answer is “This can be done and we can do it together”.
