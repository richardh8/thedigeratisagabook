# With your head over the clouds

>"Inception taught to us about the relativity and exponentiality of time across layers, cloud computing for organizations during a digital transformation process is how application development and operations teams can move fast by leveraging infrastructure as a service. The use of public clouds has shown lower costs than private clouds, and far from on-premisses datacenters, and paying only for what is used can represent considerable savings. Public clouds are also naturally accessible, allowing employees and customers to have easy access to digital solutions. The article suggests that the flexibility of public clouds is essential for survival in today's fast-changing business environment."

|Inverting mindsets to focus on your business|

>In the movie "Inception", Dom Cobb and Arthur architect dreams to reach the deepest areas of the minds of great entrepreneurs to implement a new idea.

As a mantra for business, it has always been said that every organization should focus on its business. It must specialize and constantly improve its services and products. However, every organization needs support functions to ensure that this constant improvement is sustained. Digital technologies are part of these necessary support functions.

Is keeping a team specialized in digital technology internally in the organization the best way to ensure this support? The answer to this question has been “no” for some time. We are constantly planning to use the services of respected companies to provide all the necessary infrastructure and digital management. Of course, there are always exceptions where organizations need digital expertise of such magnitude and digital support is so critical that the decision may be to internalize everything from specialized professionals to the necessary infrastructure.

In a deep process of digital transformation, one must always question the decisions made in the past related to the use of digital technologies. Is it not time to internalize all or part of the resources needed for this transformation? After all, it is a digital transformation, which implies that digital technologies have become a critical mainstay for business.

And it is at this moment that the values of what we now call cloud computing must be identified. Are we just talking about specialization and cost?

Important characteristics of cloud computing that must be taken into account during a digital transformation process:

Cost: the use of public clouds (accessible over the Internet) has shown lower costs than private clouds. And this is mainly related to 2 factors.

The exchange of assets for expenses: The use of technology instead of buying technology is a trend and has been showing lower cost;

Pay as you go: Digital technologies often have seasonal use. Therefore, paying only for what you use can represent considerable savings.

Specialization: Organizations tend to focus on their business and do not need all the specialties related to digital technologies in-house. Good quality infrastructure providers rely on specialists, which would not be feasible to internalize.

Mobility: Public clouds are naturally accessible (via the Internet), which means that both employees and customers can have easy access to digital solutions without the organization needing complex architectures to do so.

Time-to-Market: Public clouds already have all the infrastructure needed to get started quickly, removing infrastructure acquisition and management processes. And that means much less time to get solutions up and running.

Flexibility: Public clouds are naturally very flexible, which gives organizations the ability to improve and modify their business models much faster. And today, that agility is essential for survival.
