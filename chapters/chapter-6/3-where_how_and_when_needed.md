|Enabling people to do everything from wherever they are, whenever they want|

>In the movie "Æon Flux", Æon is commanded to kill Trevor Goodchild the leader of the subversive movement, but they fall in love. Æon demonstrates throughout the film, complete freedom to come and go from the city of Bregna, access the information she wants, from where, how and when.

The advent of the Internet at the beginning of the 21st century was considered a major revolution. The idea of ​​being able to access information from computers in our homes and even buy whatever we want while sitting on the sofa in the living room seemed to us a gigantic paradigm shift. However, the Internet alone has allowed us to glimpse only a few changes. The big ruptures came later, years later. And they came in areas we could never have imagined.

And then 2007 came a smartphone capable of everything, which led to an innovation that would change everything. At first, it was thought “this is just a prettier, easier-to-use phone”. But this year an overwhelming concept was introduced. The modern Swiss army knife. In the same way, as in the beginning of the Internet, it was thought that it would be just another way to communicate, but over time, the applications of this small device have grown and invaded practically all areas of human knowledge.

We are still evolving in the use of these small pieces of embedded technology. But we can already enjoy facilities unimaginable at the beginning of the century. And the main one is the magical ability of being able to do almost anything we want, whenever we want and, above all, wherever we are. Think about contacting a friend to arrange a drink, and you're done. Think about buying a last-minute gift and asking to have it delivered where you are now, done. Think about learning how to dress one out for a formal, Indian-made event. And think about knowing the temperature in New York for the next 2 days, done. And you can do it all from a downtown restaurant during your lunch break. More than 80% of internet traffic passes through Smartphone nowadays, and it is the solution that democratized and includes populations of developing countries on the Internet.

With this movement, it is necessary to think about solutions in terms of their availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without interruptions, with light, precise services and that it is possible to solve practically everything. If it doesn't, there are high chances that your users will abandon your product or service, stop that purchase, or how to proceed with a complaint. We must also understand the solution in its ubiquitous form, so the customer expects, in addition to the Application, that you also have relationship and communication facilities through social networks, messaging services. Remember, it's not just about when and where the user wants to access the service, but how they want to access the service is also something to think about.
