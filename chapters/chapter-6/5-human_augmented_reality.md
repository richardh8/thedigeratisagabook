# Human augmented reality

>"The concept of augmented reality extends beyond VR devices and can be applied in various ways to help us see, hear, perceive, calculate or feel things that our senses are not capable of alone. Augmented reality technologies can be applied during digital transformation to digitize elements of an organization's dynamics and improve employee and customer experiences. Examples of augmented reality technologies include descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics, machine learning, cognitive artificial intelligence, automation, robotization, the internet of things, and VR and AR devices."

|Augument your senses and see the world as it is|

>In the movie “Moneyball”, Peter Brand is the assistant general manager of the baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. Trained in economics, he doesn't use the intuition and experience of scouts to form the new 2002 championship team. With budget constraints, he focuses on statistics and percentages of players who make it to base, thus achieving a record 20 consecutive wins.

When we look at the title above we tend to think of VR devices, those that cover our eyes and ears and allow us to have an immersive digital experience. And we can also think of other technologies that allow us to expand our senses to see, hear and feel our reality in different ways, in an augmented way.

In fact, augmented reality is a broad term, and it is directly related to technologies, both ancient and recent, to help us see, hear, perceive, calculate or feel things that our senses are not capable of alone. We can think of a simple book, in fact, as a device capable of increasing our senses through the extension of our memory, and as a way of sharing our experiences and knowledge with other people in a much more efficient way than if we used only the our mouth and ears. Thus, when we increase our reality beyond the limitations of our body and brain processing capacity, we are much more productive and based on real facts. We can make augmented reality in many ways, from the simplest like a written text to the immersive experience that a VR device provides us. Or diagnosing a type of cancer in seconds instead of weeks through cognitive artificial intelligence.

But how is augmented reality related to digital transformation? Well, a successful digital transformation must allow elements of the organizations dynamics to be digitized (transformed into digital data). And that data must be applied directly to the continuous improvement of the business, employee and customer experiences and the value of these organizations.

In this way, technologies related to augmented reality must be applied in a way that all relevant digital data can be “felt”, understood, provoke “insights” and produce new experiences in the people who use it. Thus, we are increasing the senses of these people, allowing them to see, hear and feel aspects and nuances of the dynamics of organizations that cannot be identified only through our biological senses.

So which augmented reality technologies should we consider during a digital transformation?

- Digital Marketing: Ability to reach an audience through the Internet and provide them with an experience about products and services offered;
- Social Networks: Ability to interact with an audience, providing and receiving relevant information, without physical barriers of distance and time;
- Descriptive Analytics: Ability to format relevant information about what has happened or is happening in the organization;
- Prescriptive Analytics: Ability to infer future behaviors of the organization, its employees, its customers or the market;
- Predictive Analytics: Ability to develop recommendations for concrete actions to be carried out in organizations for the continuous improvement of their business;
- Machine Learning: Ability to infer results through previous experiences and learning;
- Cognitive Artificial Intelligence: Ability to understand texts, images and language for human integration with other algorithms;
- Deep Learning: Ability for algorithms to learn about specialized subjects and topics;
- Automation: Ability to automate simpler activities, allowing people to be freed up for higher value-added activities;
- Robotization: Ability to apply mechanical robots to perform human activities, allowing greater strength and dexterity in specific manufacturing activities, delicate procedures or risky activities;
- Internet Of Things: Ability to “feel” the behavior of equipment connected to the internet;
- VR Devices: Ability to see and hear virtual environments the same way we see and hear the physical environment around us;
- AR Devices: Ability to complement the real world with insights from the virtual world.
