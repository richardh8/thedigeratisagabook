Digital transformation is closely linked to the need to expand the use of digital services, both to improve customer experience and to increase the efficiency of internal processes. And lately, there is a lot of talk about the adoption of solutions using cloud and IT services directly connected to the Internet. But is the use of digital services fully available over the Internet safe? Does the risk of information leakage from companies, consumers and strategies increase?

Think for a minute… 20 years ago, almost all automation systems in organizations were installed in closed internal networks, IP networks for computers within this and network, and Intranet applications. And these systems were used through desktops and notebooks identified, known and managed by the area of networks and security. These equipments were designed to connect to these networks and all the technology used by the organization was limited to these internal networks, with few services integrated to the Internet. Most organizations maintained Internet integration only to allow e-mail service and Internet access for employees.

Currently, the use of digital technologies has evolved a lot and allowed the migration of on-premises solutions to cloud services. And this has led to the migration of almost all digital services to the Internet, even if accessed only by employees, through their desktops and notebooks, from the organization's offices. And with that, concerns about information security have increased. In some cases, companies have decided to maintain on-premise solutions, even at higher costs, just to ensure greater security.

But can cloud solutions hosted on the Internet guarantee the security of strategic information for organizations? What aspects should be taken into account when hosting sensitive data in Internet infrastructures?

Migration of on-premises systems: When starting to use cloud services, it is common to plan the migration of digital systems that, until then, were hosted internally. And most of the time, these same systems were developed to be used internally, and do not take into account essential characteristics when using the Internet as a means of access and security algorithms designed for this control. Assessing the internal processes of these systems prior to migration is essential.

Edge protection: As soon as digital services are available on the Internet, it must be taken into account that such services can be accessed by any device, whether notebooks, desktops, tablets and smartphones; in addition to bots, search services and other automatic services present on the world wide web. And these devices can be operated by employees of the organization, or by customers, or by anyone from anywhere in the world at any time. So services must have sufficiently sophisticated authentication processes to ensure that whoever is accessing is really who should be accessing it.

Simplicity: Digital services available on the Internet must be designed using a simple architecture. Thus, potential points of vulnerability are easily detected, mitigated and controlled. Complex services, with different access points and strategies make this control difficult and considerably increase the risks and costs related to information leaks.

Easy but secure access: All services require user identification and authentication, the password usage model is bad for security, let alone the user experience. The use of new approaches such as Biometrics, Social Network Logins, Message Activation, in addition to being more secure, provides a better experience. It also facilitates the self-service process, allowing the end user to manage and make changes to their logins without the need for offline processes or telephone contact.
