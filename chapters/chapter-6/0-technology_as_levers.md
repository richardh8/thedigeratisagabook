# Technology as Levers

Technology is an essential tool for solving business problems and achieving goals, and it should be integrated into the problem-solving process rather than treated as a separate entity. Companies can benefit from creating simple solutions to complex problems and participating in ecosystems that open their solutions to the world. It is necessary to consider solutions that are available 24/7 and provide precise services to prevent users from abandoning products or services. Cloud computing can also be leveraged during a digital transformation process to move fast and achieve significant cost savings.

Augmented reality technologies can be used to digitize elements of an organization's dynamics, improving employee and customer experiences. Security should be a primary concern when hosting sensitive data on the Internet, and new approaches like biometrics and social network logins can provide a better experience and increased security.

The proliferation of apps and the integration of APIs have opened up infinite possibilities, making it easy to solve business problems quickly and efficiently. Blockchain technology, which supports cryptocurrencies, can revolutionize the world economy with its ability to provide privacy protection and transparency. Blockchain can transform markets such as the music industry by ensuring that value for the work performed is distributed to authors and musicians, without intermediaries.

Overall, technology is a valuable tool for productivity gains, resilience, and global reach. Companies should embrace technology as a lever for growth and success, integrating it into their problem-solving process and collaborating with other functions to find solutions. As technology continues to advance and evolve, it is essential to remain aware and open-minded to take full advantage of its potential. Digital transformation journeys should include knowledge of technologies such as blockchain to lead transformations and stay ahead of the curve.
