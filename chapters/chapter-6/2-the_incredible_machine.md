# The incredible machine

>"The proliferation of technology is changing the way we design technological solutions. Integrating existing solutions is easier than creating something new from scratch, leading to the success of companies that open their solutions to the world, creating vibrant ecosystems through APIs. The focus should be on creating simple solutions to complex problems, innovating on innovations, and having a mindset focused on business opportunities. It may be better to think about participating and creating ecosystems rather than creating internal technological solutions."

>In the movie "The Imitation Game", Alan Turing, a math genius, works together with his new friends on England's most secret project. Decode the German Enigma machine.

The proliferation and popularization of the use of technologies in business is having a strange effect. Today there are technological solutions for almost everything you can think of. And the most successful solutions are those that open up to the world. They are the ones that allow other people and solutions to interact with it, adding new applications, data and capabilities, or leveraging and consuming their results.

And this revolution in the way we design technological solutions is turning traditional ways of creating technological applications upside down. It is much easier to innovate and create new business opportunities by integrating something that already exists, than creating something really new, in fact, many innovations that we have today are much more the result of these integrations than something original that is innovative and exists. by itself. It's easier to create business models based on simple additions, concatenations and integrations to existing solutions than to create an innovative technology solution from scratch.

The use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to exchange processes and data between technological solutions has gone viral and transformed solution architects into great integrators. It is better to know what already exists and be able to integrate it than to know technologies and be able to build everything from scratch.

If we look at the recent past, we notice that companies that are successful today have based their technological solutions on creating APIs that allow other solutions to integrate, creating vibrant ecosystems, whereas closed systems are becoming obsolete and myopic.

Here are some concrete examples of integrations:

    Sales Force: APIs so that other solutions can interact with your product easily;
    eBay: APIs that make your marketplace much more powerful with partner integration;
    Amazon: Which, through its e-commerce, has become the giant as a provider of technological infrastructure services;
    Flickr: That with the use of APIs, made possible a simple platform for bloggers to share their content without having to create everything from scratch;
    Facebook and Tweeter: Its complete set of APIs made it possible to create new businesses in digital marketing;
    Apple: The creation of the App Store in 2008 was a milestone in the creation of marketplaces, enabling a multitude of new businesses, which caused the globalization of smartphones;

Faced with so much technological diversity, it is important that specialists can provide simple solutions to complex problems, that they can innovate on innovations, innovate within innovations. The IT areas need to be together with the business areas to provide simple solutions to problems, with a mindset and vocabulary focused on business opportunities.

So, is creating internal technological solutions in organizations, even using the latest technologies, the answer? Maybe it's better to think about integrating solutions, participating and creating ecosystems, which are much more like amazing machines.
