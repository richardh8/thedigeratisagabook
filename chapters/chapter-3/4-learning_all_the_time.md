# Learning all the time

>"In a rapidly changing job market, traditional education models are not meeting the urgent need for professionals with new and diverse skill sets. Nanodegree diplomas offer short-term, low-cost, and self-directed learning opportunities for professionals to quickly adapt to market demands. Innovative organizations are turning to continuous learning to develop critical and relevant human capital, and organizations that promote and value continuous learning can gain a competitive advantage."

>In the movie "Edge of Tomorrow", reservist Major William Cage is attacked by Omega, the entity that controls time. He finds himself caught in a loop between death and life, returning to the day he arrived at London's military base, where he meets Rita Vrataski, who dies in an attack on the first day of his mission against the aliens. Dozens of times alone in this loop, he fails, but he learned in all its details the routine of his loop, becoming a war master, managing to save Rita and get out of the loop.

The term “job crisis” is increasingly used and demonstrates a global perception that there is a lack of professionals prepared to meet the demands of today's job market. In these new times where actions must be designed for a VUCA world — Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous, individuals cannot lose pace and rhythm, as well as timing to learn things capabilities.

In fact, with the accelerated pace of the market, there is a growing demand for professionals prepared to assume different positions at all levels of the organization, even more if we consider the growing demands generated by digital transformations. There is an intense demand for ready people in the short term and these talents are increasingly scarce and competitive. And we see that the traditional models of education, training and development, such as colleges, graduate degrees, MBAs, masters and doctorates, no longer satisfactorily meet the urgency proposed by constant changes and the pace of generation of new skills. The current learning format can be seen as classic and is not adequately addressing these market needs. Not that they have to be discarded, after all, they have been responsible for a long time for directing people's education. But the market needs add-ons that can help support the current demand of our dynamic market.

The paradigm shift points to new forms and modalities of training aimed at continuous actions, with a view to enhancing learning beyond the classroom with greater focus on the learner's self-direction. A degree that allows learning to be mixed with corporate practice focused on concrete results, outside the laboratories. This continuous and blended approach to learning and practice facilitates the application of acquired knowledge and skills.

Nanodegree diplomas, as short-term courses are known, are beginning to present themselves as a solution that helps professionals to prepare themselves in a continuous and faster way. Allowing the acquired knowledge to be applied quickly. In addition to having lower costs, they have the ability to participate from anywhere. They allow the professional to become able to meet the needs of a digital transformation process quickly. They are able to bring results in short-term missions without the need for 2 or 4 years of training. With the use of new ways of acquiring knowledge and skills, organizations can invest in the application of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, using their own professionals.

These nanodegree models allow the acquisition of knowledge quickly and continuously. Online courses such as Udemy and Udacity make cutting-edge knowledge, supported by renowned scientists and thinkers, available to anyone in the world at a low cost. In addition to these, there is an immense range of free courses, such as those from Harvard, MIT and many other workshops and forums, available for practically all areas of human knowledge, functioning as small learning capsules for quick training.

This new paradigm proposes continuous self-learning using resources that can come in written form, podcast and online video, even with the application of virtual reality and augmented reality. This different trend can be noticed in innovative organizations that turn to continuous learning, massively exploiting digital technologies for this, enabling their employees to acquire and apply knowledge quickly. These new ways of structuring corporate education programs that are more up-to-date, agile and suitable for the digital context allow the development of a more critical, relevant, creative human capital and, above all, prepared to meet the demands of the organization.

Now, it is up to organizations to review their training requirements, either at the time of hiring or during a career growth opportunity. It may be that the ability of professionals to seek continuous learning becomes a greater differentiator during hiring and promotions than the technical skills themselves. Promoting continuing education and valuing professionals who learn in this way can become a great competitive advantage for organizations.
