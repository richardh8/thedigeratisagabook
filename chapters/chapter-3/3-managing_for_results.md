>In the movie “Mission Impossible 2”, Ethan Hunt is a secret agent, always called to critical missions due to his successful track record. He is given the mission to retrieve the Chimera, a biological weapon. For this he summons some friends and has full autonomy and support to fulfill his mission.

We are living in a world in continuous mutation, where new ideas are constantly emerging, where organizations must be attentive to market movements to maintain their relevance and also to take advantage of the great opportunities that a dynamic market offers. Using a static annual planning model is meaningless. Also, detailed long-term plans quickly lose relevance. And, especially, in a dynamic market, static planning restricts the vision and does not encourage the exploration of new opportunities.

In this environment, employees feel that they are performing tasks without understanding their purposes, causing a drastic reduction in engagement and, as a consequence, in their productivity and effectiveness in achieving results.

A change within organizations is necessary to align them with these new times. There is always talk of becoming more dynamic, more agile. But how can this be done?

First, it is important to understand that this is a cultural change, which must run in all corners of the organization and must be supported by its leaders and by clear purposes. This change must focus on generating results by each of its employees and on the correct recognition in line with the results obtained.

Teams need to be properly allocated to achieve results which together form deliverables, customer acquisitions, revenue growth, cost efficiency, etc. This design of results comes from clear organizational strategies.

For example, in a digital transformation journey, a roadmap is defined as a collection of milestones, where each of these milestones is defined with purpose, relevance, realism and clarity. They are not merely results to be achieved within a specific project disconnected from the whole. And to make them more attractive to their performers, they must contain three important elements.

The first element is the objective itself, it is the expected result of a delivery. It is the clear definition of its purpose, aligned with the larger goals of the organization. It can also contain an extension, something that encourages teams to go a little further.

The second element is related to personal development. What will those involved learn by working towards this goal? We know that employees always want to be developing and think they can learn from the activities they are doing. Knowledge is the driving force for evolution and continuous improvement. Identifying this new knowledge and acquired experiences is crucial to engaging people in their personal growth and development goals.

And the third element is related to the identification of what those involved will bring to the organization that is beyond the achieved result. During the conduct of activities, teams must be able to identify new processes, innovations, practices, or partners, in order to add value to the organization as a whole. This is where the fusion of theory and practice takes place, this is where experimentation and learning takes place effectively.

For example, there is already a movement originating from exponential organizations that is the adoption of OKRs (Objective and Key Results), which is being applied in large organizations as well as Startups. OKR is a methodology for agile performance management. It motivates employees to work together, focusing efforts to make measurable and challenging contributions. The use of OKR allows an employee to manage their freedom and autonomy, which is reflected in empowerment over actions, decisions, ideas, way of working and collaboration to carry out challenges and achieve challenging goals. In applying the OKR, it is essential that the company demonstrates how the recognition of its employees for their results works, adopting a clear model of meritocracy linked to the order of magnitude of the result sought. In the same way that it becomes fundamental for the success of this model, that the employee also perceives and fits into this new work model, which now requires attitude, leadership, self-management, decision and protagonism.

In some cases, there is an adjustment period. Neither the leadership nor the employees are adjusted to a management paradigm break, where teams are given freedom of thought, creative freedom, freedom of action and freedom to propose discussions without someone in control. On a personal level, the employee should think about what he learned in the process and how he will be better prepared for the next journey. As far as the organization is concerned, one should think about how to design the necessary deliverables, evaluating different domains such as people, value, technology, business, etc. Employees must be allowed to think outside the box and broaden their knowledge. The idea is not just to do things just for the sake of doing them, but to learn new things with each new cycle.
