>In the movie “Braveheart”, William Wallace leads the Scottish rebels in the fight against the rule of the English King Edward I. They couldn't stand the abuses of the English army anymore. After winning countless battles, he is betrayed by the Scottish nobles themselves, ending up tortured and executed in the public square.

One of the major reasons why employees are unhappy and unmotivated, as numerous recent surveys point out, can be defined as a lack of synergy between their purpose and that of the organization. Yes, it happens a lot. But it's also common to see dissatisfied employees who don't look for ways to adapt and align with an organization's purposes. They should ask themselves. What is my motivation for being here? What problem do I want to solve? What is my contribution to this organization? How can I positively impact society? These questions can guide employees' expectations and help them align their purposes with those of the organizations they work for.

We have entered a new era where successful organizations are fueled by passion and purpose, not just the money they generate. People are also more aware of their role as a professional and in society. And these people would only work in organizations where their purposes are aligned.

There is today a great concern with the social and with the sustainable. And more and more competent professionals would decline invitations to work for organizations with purposes contrary to these values.

Working with purpose is no longer a privilege and has become part of the search for personal fulfillment. Working with purpose tends to transform work into more than just a job or a career, but into an engagement and a hero in difficult times. People understand that their talents are at the service of something they believe in.

The time has come for people to take responsibility for their life purpose, their career and how to apply their talents and skills to achieve personal fulfillment. Self-knowledge, insight into your skills, interests, talents and passions are the first step to understanding the right path.

Also, organizations must rethink their motivational strategies. A good salary may not be the main motivator for talent acquisition and retention. In fact, they must make their purposes as transparent and clear as possible. And ensure that such purposes are authentic. That alone could be enough to attract people who believe in these purposes. And these people would easily engage in the proposed challenges.

Through clarity of communication and common interests, connection and empathy, organizations and employees can walk together and understand that their purposes are aligned.

In the course of a digital transformation journey, there are moments where organizational values and cultures are revisited. There is a questioning about the purpose of the organization. And that will impact your employees. There may be different reactions, whether euphoria or engagement, but also resistance, lack of belief in action and insecurity. It is important for leaders to assess the conditions of how to build this journey, understanding the purposes that make their employees there and aligning them with the new organizational purposes that may come. One must identify which talents, experiences, new skills and knowledge need to be established. In this way, you can retain and attract the right professionals who will be able to successfully lead the transition. Also, this journey should be built together with the teams rather than through executive summary decisions or recommendations from external consultants. It is rare for such strategies to create employee engagement and the chances of failure are high. Without the mutual support of leaders and employees, a process of sabotage can begin, incurring delays, errors and increases in costs and investments.

When preparing for a digital transformation journey, a frank conversation with everyone is crucial. Understanding whether the path the organization has decided to take makes sense for its employees and society. You should ask everyone and yourself: What is yours?
