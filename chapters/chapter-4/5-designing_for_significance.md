# Designing for significance

>"The presence of a sense of purpose and meaning is fundamental for adequate performance in any activity. Clarity in vision, purpose, and meaning is crucial for employee engagement and a company's ability to execute strategically. Consumers demand a broader action concerned with issues of public interest, and businesses with a clear sense of purpose can attract new talent, promote a cooperative culture, and represent a competitive advantage."

Leading an organization towards its goals is a big challenge. A legitimate work of orchestration of processes, technologies and, above all, people. When it comes to constantly aligning resources in favor of strategy, having clarity of purpose in the minds of all involved is one of the items that favors employee engagement around stated goals and brings the company closer to customers with more lasting connections. This doesn't just happen in the corporate environment. In practically any activity that a person needs to perform during medium and long term periods with adequate performance, the presence of a sense of purpose and meaning is fundamental.

According to Simon Sinek, author of the book “Start With Why”, in relation to his proposition of the so-called “Golden Circle”, innovative companies that are clear about why they exist manage to inspire the action of their employees as well as their customers. They do this because they capture people's unconscious through purposes and values compatible with theirs. For him, many still fail because they focus their communication on other instances: “What” and How”, that is, they are concerned with connecting people with “what” they do and “how” they do it, when the important thing is. it is to focus on the “why”, which is the purpose and meaning for which the company exists, thinks and acts in the market.

Therefore, clarity in vision, purpose and meaning, although they seem simple and obvious issues, when they are not well consolidated in an organization, they can diminish its ability to execute strategically. On this, a Harvard Business Review article called “When CEOs Speak, Is Anyone Listening?” addresses an important situation on this topic. According to a survey, 70% of employees are unaware or misaligned with the company's strategic direction, that is, there is little understanding of why the business exists and why it is worth investing effort in the future. Nor are they clear on how their concrete workplace initiatives connect to the company's larger purpose, such as better serving its customers.

From the point of view of the market, consumers are increasingly demonstrating that they are not only satisfied with the possibility of acquiring more products and services, but rather expect behavior that transcends meeting quality and price requirements. Unlike past generations, new consumers demand a broader action, concerned with issues of public interest and symbolic universes capable of generating rational and affective connections. The Millennial Survey, published by Deloitte, addressed the customs of the generation of people born after 1986. The survey that was carried out with more than 7,800 people around the world and concluded that millennials value the purpose of the business more than profit. Given this scenario, it is clear that establishing a constant sense of purpose is of utmost importance. In this direction, the organization understands the achievement of success, customer service and growth more consciously as a matter of alignment. With a clear vision and constant communication, belief in a purpose can represent a competitive advantage, allowing consistent exponential growth, attracting new talent connected to the proposal and promoting a cooperative culture.
