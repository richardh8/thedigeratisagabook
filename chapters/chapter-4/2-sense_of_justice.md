|Customers want fair answers to problems|

>In the movie “John Wick”, John has his car stolen and his dog murdered by the son of a great Russian mobster. He single-handedly faces dozens of gangsters until he kills the mafia boss. All in the name of justice.

There was a time when it was still possible for companies to continue to exist without the slightest concern for customer service. Competition, technology, and social networks have radically altered this scenario. Interestingly, there are still giants of resistance who insist on believing that it is possible to remain in the market by delivering low-quality experiences that are exclusively focused on sales. Although there has been talk for decades about the danger of strict sales guidance, many companies still operate with the financial transaction itself in mind.

Digital has increased transparency as a key factor in consumer relations, as nonconformities with shopping experiences are shared daily on social networks and there is no way to contain this movement, and nor should it.

Thus, the sense of fairness is the desire to be getting the best deal, paying for what is actually delivered. Companies that deliver compliance come out ahead and are able to offer reinforcements of earnings, emphasizing from time to time that the choice made by the consumer was the right one. Conformity is one item included among others that reflect the quality of a product. It is nothing more than how much this product reflects in the delivery what is promised, or required by technical standards compared to what is expected by the user. Have you ever weighed the food packages you buy? Did you measure the waiting time for the service? Have you evaluated the internet connection you receive at home? If not, you may be surprised that, in practice, many things do not work as promised.

Companies looking for digital transformation invest in constantly monitoring their deliveries and anticipating possible nonconformities in their quality and commitment to the customer. But what if the company fails at some point? Different from what many think, failure, when well managed, can become an event that boosts loyalty and not the abandonment of the service or product. This is because customers are also interested in knowing how a company reacts when it fails, as their attitude will reflect the real commitment to quality and concern for them. Therefore, facing each failure with agility and seriousness, in addition to generating the lessons learned, makes it possible to reinforce the brand's identity, manifested in its actions, even in unfavorable situations, concerned with the customer.

The sense of justice also brings with it the desire for simplicity. After all, digital when well planned and executed, meets the conditions for this. Less is more. Amid the saturation of information we experience daily, this is almost an absolute truth. Design, processes, communication, among other aspects, must have clarity, simplicity and objectivity as their basis for action. Even if dealing with the complex, there is no need to make it complicated. In the wake of simplicity, we already have a client who increasingly expects the presence of a personalized approach, in which he perceives the company's intelligence and organization in learning from the various interactions he performs. Although it seems a bit obvious nowadays, not infrequently customers need to enter their data, confirm their full names, many in the same iteration, and what they receive in return is that they still do not perceive any type of value or recognition of their profile. . Sometimes, not even the customer's own history the company can use in a relevant way. Except those that have gone through the digital transformation.

We must treat customers with transparency and candor, and do our best to remedy any errors, and never incite that the customer is the one who has done wrong.
