|Don't insult your customer, make them your ally|

>In the movie "Up in the air", Ryan Bingham sees his "outplacement" job threatened, as his new co-worker Natalie Keener, develops a solution using video conferencing to fire people. This causes a transformation in Ryan as he starts to see the people he fires as human and as customers who can be loyal to his work.

There is a “magical” way of thinking by which companies believe that they will retain their customers through the most diverse types of pleasures, in the good will of “enchanting” them. Countless are the times that Disney's case of excellence in satisfying customers has been addressed in team meetings that deal with customer service and satisfaction. Nothing against this type of initiative, as long as, above all, they are committed to the most important thing in this journey: efficiently solving customer problems, starting with solving the organization's own problems.

It may seem so obvious, but ask yourself: how many times does a consumer leave a company due to service issues? Certainly, a number much greater than the number of customers who say they are so delighted with a particular company and its service provision that they become loyal, never consuming from competitors again.

Yes, before thinking about "exceeding expectations" of the market, it is necessary to face the problems related to the quality of delivery of your products and services, trying to achieve high standard compliance. Believe me, the customer is more interested in the company's posture and commitment to fulfilling its value proposition effectively than receiving pampering or fancy special effects, which quickly disappear in their impact and function and which reflect short-term marketing campaigns. term, often responding to tactical company actions. However, most companies do not realize this and pay dearly with wasted investment and lost customers. A study carried out by the Customer Contact Council with more than 75 thousand people came to the conclusion that delighting the customer does not produce loyalty. What is really relevant is helping the customer to reduce their effort to have their problem resolved.

In this way, investing in understanding the customer's journey and the tasks they face during the resolution of a given problem is the real “job to be done”. This will help the company to identify what it really needs to handle and resolve in its service. Below are some important points that can help companies in this challenge:

Don't transfer the blame for problems to your customers: Although there are situations in which customers have a decisive role in creating value, see the problems as yours and not theirs. Some companies have the incredible “ability” to create systems, standards and procedures that create more difficulties than ease for the customer. This strategy externalizes its processes in an inside-out view, often used to try to solve some internal inefficiency, but putting all the responsibility on the customer. This makes the failures that occur along the processes seem more like the customer's fault than the company's.

Don't just solve the present problem: A step forward in the decision to satisfy your customer is in the attitude of not only solving customer problems, but dedicating yourself to preventing them. For this, it is necessary to pay attention to the learning process, responsiveness, constant analysis of information and predictive capacity. Digital has helped companies in this regard, integrating tools that provide companies with valuable information, favoring the prediction of customer actions and surprising them with innovative solutions to problems that they sometimes did not even know they had.

If you fail, show commitment as someone who is genuinely interested in the customer: Have your own friendly way of apologizing and show interest in acting on your customer's behalf. Customers usually accept, occasionally, the occurrence of failures, but always wait for the company's attitude and response. Amazingly, a failure can be a great opportunity to build customer loyalty, as long as the answer comes from someone who really cares about their customer's satisfaction.

Keep communication channels open and legitimate: few companies realize that they have qualified consultants available to their own customers every day. Establishing efficient ways to maintain a relationship and constant feedback helps to stimulate the partnership between company and customer in a continuous improvement of the product or service.

Never consider that a customer comes to you with the intention of bothering you: if he came to you it is because he believes, or still hopes, that you can do something for him. Count on him as a business partner. Although some actions focused on solving internal problems may have some kind of cost, the main point is that many of the failures that generate higher levels of dissatisfaction can be totally eliminated with small technical or managerial corrections.

Therefore, more than a budget for improvements, the company needs to have leaders committed to customer satisfaction and to empower the front-line staff to solve the problem.
