# Accepting the duality of the world

>"The movie "The Matrix" illustrates the duality of the real and digital worlds and how they promote a single experience. Similarly, a company seeking digital transformation must excel in both physical and digital spheres, delivering value to clients and stakeholders regardless of the channel. To provide an integrated and relevant experience, it is necessary to recognize who is performing a certain action and activate their histories, preferences, and other information in real-time. The context of consumer actions and their expectations of agility, transparency, and efficiency created by the digital environment should be extended to service and physical relationships, promoting consistent experiences that align with the brand's purpose and message."

|Real world and Digital, delivering value for both worlds|

>In the movie “The Matrix”, Neo visits the Oracle and meets a boy with extraordinary abilities, who shows him how the real world is confused with the non-real, or simulated. Both worlds promote a single experience to human consciousness.

A company that seeks Digital Transformation needs to be able to act with mastery both in the physical and digital spheres, generating value for each client and for other stakeholders, regardless of whether it is dealing face-to-face with them or with their “avatar” online.

Always connected to the Internet and with the cell phone in hand, the user seeks convenience and agility. Want to have the freedom to do research in one medium, buy in another and receive from a third party, generating the latent need for a management that understands and integrates all points of contact, be it the physical store, e-commerce, m-commerce , smart TV, phone, etc. With omnichannel, the separations between physical and virtual commerce become increasingly obsolete as many companies adopt increasingly sophisticated solutions, focused on the consumer and their offline and online journeys.

In this approach, the objective is to make the consumer not perceive the difference between the online and offline world, integrating physical and virtual stores and buyers. In this way, it can explore all the possibilities of interaction and learning resulting from each action, based on the convergence of all channels used by a company.

For the more traditional companies that have been in the market for a long time, it is a challenge to lead the customer through a fully digital experience, just as for digital native companies it can be challenging to physically deal with customers. However, the proposal is, less and less, to differentiate online and offline, but to offer coherent and integrated brand experiences to its Branding.

Despite this, we still see the gap between teams, for example, those focused on Point of Sale (physical POS), and teams focused on e-commerce. All this with results measured separately, as if one had no influence on the performance of the other.

In order to offer an integrated and relevant experience at all times, a support structure is needed that is able to constantly recognize, in each interaction, who is the person/avatar who is performing a certain action, activating in real time histories, preferences, projections and other information that provides value to both the customer and the company, determining the necessary actions at each stage of this interaction. The context in which actions are carried out by consumers has also become a very important variable. Technology helps in this sense, recognizing the most appropriate moments and places for a certain action to be carried out on behalf of the user, meeting their intentions and motivations. In the physical sphere, it would be very similar to the traditional approach of salespeople, who seek to find out with the potential customer what type of use will be made with the product, in what social or psychological circumstances so that, from this information, he has more conditions to optimize your communication. It is worth mentioning that the possibilities allowed by technology and the digital environment created in the consumer an expectation leveled by the agility, transparency and efficiency that this combination of worlds allowed, therefore, it is necessary that these elements of the digital are extended to the service and physical relationship. It's no use having the website that loads faster, when the delivery doesn't meet the deadlines. Much less promote a fully interactive digital environment and, on the other hand, a climate of apathy in stores. Always remember: build the strength of your brand by promoting experiences that are consistent and coherent with your purpose and your speech. Pursue this, regardless of the channel in question.
