# Diversity as a platform

>"Diversity is not just a social inclusion issue but also an important element for organizations to deliver value in the current period. It fosters innovation and increases engagement, which is beneficial for organizations. Companies need to identify the diverse groups and develop communication, motivation, engagement, and development practices that are consistent with each one of them. By adopting diversity as an element of their culture, organizations can enjoy benefits such as a sense of belonging, image of the organization, innovation-friendly environment, and better coping with difficulties. However, leadership plays a significant role in constantly supporting and encouraging diversity in the organization."

Diversity is a theme that goes beyond questions and discussions only from the perspective of social inclusion, but also presents itself as an ally to organizations that intend to continue to deliver value in the current period, where people from groups co-exist both in the market and in companies. very different generations, cultures, religions, and genders. In a way, by knowing how to manage this internal heterogeneity and take advantage of it efficiently, companies gain in skills to know how to deal with the same differences that are out there, when the bias turns to their consumer market.

Therefore, organizations need to identify these groups and profiles well to get to know them and develop communication, motivation, engagement and development practices that are consistent with each one of them. These items are fundamental because the propositions made to a group in these dimensions can have a high positive impact, but, on the other hand, in another group it may not even be enough to achieve a “yellow smile”. Diversity is also a great ally in fostering innovation, one of the central dimensions in organizations' strategies. Differences in life experiences, origins and culture of professionals increase the chances that the environment will stimulate innovation. A Harvard Business Review survey revealed that in companies where the diversity environment is recognized, employees are 17% more engaged and willing to go above and beyond their responsibilities. In addition, according to a study by McKinsey & Company, companies with ethnic and racial diversity are 35% more likely to have results above the average for their industry.

However, to incorporate diversity as truth into their structures, companies need to fight the ethnocentric model. In organizations, this condition prevents new ideas from being heard or new proposals being analyzed, hindering the general development of the company. An ethnocentric person considers his culture to be the main or superior to others, not respecting or caring for people of different cultural standards. A clear reflection of the lack of empathy. By adopting diversity as an element of your culture, several benefits can be experienced:

Sense of belonging and desire to stay: when people perceive that they are valued and have opportunities for growth, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality or specific needs, people experience a sense of belonging, which favors collaboration and reduced turnover.

Image of the organization and attractiveness: a company that values diversity and offers opportunities considering the competence of the person introduces this initiative to its brand image, which ends up generating attractiveness for new talents. In addition, customers who belong to the social groups included begin to identify with the company.

Innovation-friendly environment: Diverse teams can facilitate the development of innovative products and services. The existence of people with different backgrounds and experiences can make innovation dynamics very rich and are already guided by multifocal ideas.

Conditions for better coping with difficulties: in moments of uncertainty in the market, flexibility can be a facilitating aspect to face difficulties. Organizations that are tolerant of diversity and value “thinking outside the box” may benefit from this environment.

Of course, an environment in which diversity is seen as an advantage, needs the constant support of the leadership, in the sense of constantly transmitting clear messages, worrying about the development of its team, encouraging and recognizing the differences as something positive, taking advantage of the diverse skills in the best way, maximizing the efficiency of their teams and, consequently, of the company as a whole.
