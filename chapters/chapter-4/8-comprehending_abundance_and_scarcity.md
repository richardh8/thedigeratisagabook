>In the movie “Men in Black 3”, Agents K and J maintain order and law on planet earth, but not for humans, but for the extraterrestrial communities from various regions of the universe that visit us and live here. They have access to an immense range of interstellar technologies and knowledge, but they restrict other humans from understanding that we are part of something much bigger.

Technology has changed the dynamics and speed at which the demand and supply of new products and solutions are presented to the market and society. It is not difficult to understand this change. In the industrial revolution, there was an increase in scale in the production of products and consumption, with the evolution of the means of mass manufacturing. After this period, with the market heated up by a large number of products and some social and cultural changes, such as the entry of women into the labor market, there was a new growth, with the emergence of the so-called service economy. Currently, we are experiencing a moment of rupture where, for many, this new market growth milestone is happening, called Industry 4.0. The fact is that science and technology and their current developments have allowed the emergence of companies capable of reaching customers and users around the world, generating market value in a few years that large traditional players took decades to achieve. More than that, they were able to deliver real value, solving problems that practically no one was able to even see as an opportunity. As Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler state in “Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think”, humanity is experiencing a period of radical transformation, in which technology is substantially raising the basic living standards of all inhabitants of the world. planet. For them, by the 2040s, we will be able to provide goods and services previously reserved for a wealthy minority, to anyone and everyone who needs them.

In this new scenario, in order to make a difference and act under the exponential logic, companies need to develop the competence to see the opportunities that already exist. It is necessary to envision the existence of two basic issues: abundance and scarcity. These two dimensions complement each other and were responsible for driving the growth of so-called exponential organizations, here are some examples of this happening:

Google: discovered in the abundance of data in the digital environment a scarcity of treatment of this information. With that, it conceived a series of products under the logic of “organizing the world's information”, taking strategic knowledge through its algorithms and solutions in this line of solutions.

Airbnb: found an abundance of idleness in housing units available around the world, in addition to the possibility of turning each person who owns a house or apartment into an entrepreneur and earning from it, in addition to the scarcity of solutions that adequately connect existing offers to the demand for this service, already great but potentially greater as new solutions emerge.

Uber: Envisioned an abundance of digital information about people's movement through the streets and roads, and an abundance of potential new drivers. This added to the lack of quality in service and the precariousness of public transport, provided a solution that solved this equation, also counting on the facilities that the application brought to the user, used to ordering a taxi through phone calls or "hunting" some by the streets.

Digital transformation offers companies the possibility of being prepared to quickly read this scenario of constant changes, as well as the structure and intelligence necessary to offer new solutions that connect scarcity to abundance and, in this way, become the new organizations. exponential growth rates, which grow far above the average of their competitors and markets.
