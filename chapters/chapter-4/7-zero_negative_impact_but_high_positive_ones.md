>In the movie "Deep Impact", Leo Biederman is a young man who will be a father soon, but he lives the anguish of the imminent risk of everyone on the planet dying due to a large meteor that is heading towards Earth. With the world united to a common purpose, the most diverse innovations were built to protect and fight the meteor. A group of astronauts managed to blow up the meteor, but even then the earth was hit by a much smaller piece, killing thousands of people but saving the vast majority.

We experience, practically every day, products and services offered by companies considered “exponential organizations”. This denomination was given to those whose impact and results are disproportionately large compared to their peers, due to the use of new organizational techniques that leverage technology as a vector for accelerating their growth. Some well-known examples are Google, YouTube, Airbnb, WeChat, Alibaba, Netflix, Amazon, Uber, Apple and Facebook, among many others that are consolidating in increasing numbers.

Thus, we live in a historic moment, in which the possibility of creating new solutions, with great social, environmental, and economic impact, is accessible to many companies, Startups and even new entrepreneurs that are about to emerge. In addition to the vertiginous growth, these organizations also draw attention to the fact that they have become “giants” without necessarily generating negative impacts on society, the economy, and the environment in which they operate.

The big question to be understood in this aspect is that, for a long time, to achieve results of the magnitude that these new organizations are achieving, many of the traditional businesses generated negative impacts on their ecosystem. Therefore, it was not by chance that the growing movement demanding sustainability gained strength in the main economic axes. As well as businesses that were monopolized, that generated economic impacts when they collapsed, causing high unemployment, or crashing stock markets.

Although the proposal to minimize negative impacts is not new, something addressed by the Triple Bottom Line, for example, this notion has expanded in the exponential era. It is necessary to think of new ways to, at the same time, generate growth and solutions with a high positive impact for society, on large scales of growth, but also to minimize negative impacts. In this sense, the notion of negative consequences is expanded to dimensions that have not yet been explored, such as the consumer's physical, emotional and cognitive experience, for example. And the company's own employees. In a way, this approach is directly related to the concept of customer value, which proposes that, in order to increase the value perceived by customers, the product must constantly increase the benefits delivered. However, this same concept considers the comparison of the benefits with the costs involved in the acquisition, use, disposal, etc, of this product. Thus, at the present time, we are witnessing greater attention to this second aspect, the reduction of costs, that is, the negative impacts.

Today we live in a world of abundance of resources, from capital to consumer goods, and we have to know how to unite the shared economy, with the power of crowdfunding, and crowdsourcing, identify the scarcity of certain regions of the planet about services and products, and build a model that knows how to leverage technology, regulations, policies and social platforms, already in the hands of thousands of human beings, to create with them a value that is integrated with the value for their customers, which is value for their own organization.

The companies' own innovation initiatives have expanded their scope, proposing, in addition to new functionalities and incremental improvements focused on the product, ways to reduce the negative impacts to the user in their purchase and use of these products, including especially the disposal, recycling and exchange of old products for new ones.
