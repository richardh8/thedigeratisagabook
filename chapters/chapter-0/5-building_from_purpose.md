>"The truth holds different perspectives and interpretations, but your passion to a given problem in society is unquestionable, it can gain many forms and shapes, but it composes the building of intentions, is the true compass and a clear divisor for the decisions and choices you have to make to achieve innovations applying digital capabilities."

Building from purpose is a powerful concept that has the potential to transform businesses and organizations. When employees are connected to a shared purpose, they are more engaged, motivated, and productive, and they are more likely to make decisions that support the success of the organization.

In today's fast-paced and constantly changing digital world, it's more important than ever for businesses to be purpose-driven. The digital world presents endless opportunities for innovation, growth, and success, but it also requires a clear sense of direction and a shared vision for the future. That's where purpose comes in.

Purpose is the foundation of every successful business and organization. It provides a clear sense of direction and helps to guide decision making, ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. When employees are connected to a shared purpose, they are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and productive, and they are more likely to make decisions that support the success of the organization.

Building from purpose also helps to align employees around a shared vision for the future. This shared vision provides a sense of direction and helps to create a more collaborative and inclusive workplace. By connecting employees to a shared purpose, leaders can tap into the creativity and expertise of their employees, and create a more agile and responsive organization.

Purpose also has the power to drive innovation. When employees are connected to a shared purpose, they are more likely to be innovative, to experiment, and to take risks. This innovative mindset is essential for success in the digital world, where businesses must be able to adapt quickly and effectively in order to stay ahead of the curve.

In addition to driving innovation, purpose also provides a long-term vision for the organization. This long-term vision helps to guide decision making and ensures that everyone is working towards a common goal. By focusing on purpose, businesses can avoid the pitfalls of short-term thinking and focus on creating sustainable and meaningful growth.

So, how can businesses build from purpose? The first step is to identify the shared purpose of the organization. This may involve conducting research, engaging employees, and considering the values and principles that are important to the organization. Once the shared purpose has been identified, it's important to communicate this purpose to employees and to ensure that it is integrated into the culture and processes of the organization.

The next step is to align employees around this shared purpose. This may involve creating opportunities for employees to connect with each other and with the purpose of the organization, and to participate in decision making and problem solving. By creating a culture of collaboration and inclusion, businesses can tap into the creativity and expertise of their employees and create a more agile and responsive organization.

Finally, it's important to ensure that purpose is integrated into daily decision making. This may involve creating processes and systems that support purpose-driven decision making, and providing employees with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions. By empowering employees to make decisions based on purpose, businesses can ensure that they are working towards a common goal and creating value for society.

In conclusion, building from purpose is a powerful concept that has the potential to transform businesses and organizations. When employees are connected to a shared purpose, they are more engaged, motivated, and productive, and they are more likely to make decisions that support the success of the organization. Purpose provides a clear sense of direction, drives innovation, and provides a long-term vision for the organization. So, if you're ready to take your business to the next level, embrace the power of purpose and build from it!
