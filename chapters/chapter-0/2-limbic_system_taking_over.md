# Limbic system taking over

>"Even though freezing might save your life in the face of imminent danger, flying away from your strategic digital transformation is not an option, and that's going to get you disrupted very quickly. When a fight kicks in, having room to make  decisions next, at least gives a quantum moment in advance, so you have a chance to explore space and time, while learning and evolving."

CEOs, Founders and Executives are all humans for sure, with their qualities and failing abilities, like anyone else, but they are sitting in positions at the high ranks because of their experiences, seniority and backgrounds, so all the organizations they are leading, are more than counting on them to everything that will show up as a problem, which will become a challenge, and soon an opportunity, but how many times that opportunity is abandoned, in detriment of fear and shame? Even though the market praises for executive leaders qualities and success stories across the news and social media, leaders in general rely most of the time on their achievements, like receipts of repeatable success, relying on solid arguments and logic, the executive board and shareholders simply comply, that's because this group will tend to focus on their financial interests, as shareholders want to reduce their risks over their investments, and executives not be threaten on losing their seats and their wages and bonuses, or equities as well. But the most important area is not represented at this board, that is the organization overall, the management and employees from all areas who run the business, but they are the engines and the means to face the challenge, so why reduce its capabilities and throughput? The organization must be managed and led carefully, your business is in a race of many rounds, and strategy here, allied to thought-through guided principles and values, are keys to embrace the organization in a novel to overcome challenges and boost the business forward. Organizations that are successful only when the market conditions and economies are  strong, have not yet faced pain, they have not gone   through deeper lessons of their character and principles. Up to then, principles and cultural values are empty messages hanging on the office walls, in solitude, managed and contained within the "People" Department, a small rebrand from Human Resources, but with "cool" features, with CEOs and Founders input and taste. At the first burp on the road, these principles and cultural values are like ghosts from a long past, and everyone just feels stuck to what a "logical" action must be, it's almost intuitive, the business will not think as business, but as operation, and from there, everything becomes a dollar figure with some colorful data around it. The lay-offs are not well understood by its creators and executors, once faced with headwinds, and you can't stand your principles and values, you are failing, and justify lay-offs on the premises of financial fundamentals, and for preparedness for the challenges ahead, actually is the worst failure executives commit, and the one with worst outlook and forecast, because they think they will reduce costs, but will be able to maintain and grow the business again, with the same people they founded the company, a negative spiral which will not end well. Companies that lay-off massively, proved that the CEO and the executive body messed up pretty bad, just like when you go to a buffet, you serve yourself with too much food on your plate, but then you leave the remainders, so leaders failed on their plans, failed on execution, and produced expensive waste, at a irresponsible and immature rate. But we are talking about people here, so the damage is way worse than throwing food out. Can you see how this reaction is simply the ones originated from the limbic system, and it's tricking you to make an urgent decision, and that you are not allowing your frontal cortex to act, and be courageous to make the challenge an opportunity that will make possible huge returns to all? Be quite, stop and hide, until things are safe again, proves on itself that your business is not really that status-quo challenger, is running away from the battles to be faced, you didn't even intend to not be a coward, or exhaust and fight for principles, values and delineate a strategy, even a counter-intuitive one. Leaders in this situation miss the opportunity, to promote growth of the trust of the organization on themselves, boosting morale, summoning your most valuable resources to a stronger purpose, and allowing them at least the chance to overcome the challenge and produce some of the most astonishing learnings and form through real-life experience, the character, principles and values of your organization? Don't forget your principles and values, never, the world has given you the chance to prove yourself, to overcome your own limits, and overcome what you control and don't control, what's the legacy you will be leaving behind for yourself and the organization?

Beyond the lay-offs, there will be many different headwinds and blockers, and they will mostly come out from the uncontrolled quadrant, that's why, we got to fight, persist, be opened about it, ask for help, within the right frame of mind, it's ok to be vulnerable, feel like an impostor, and weak, but surely your organization will respond with the power of the crowds, built in trust, organizations going through digital transformation will likely create and execute on the most challenging opportunities.
