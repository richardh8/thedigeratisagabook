|Your core business in the ecosystem, focus on what you are good at|

Understanding the business world as an ecosystem is an essential strategy for organizations that want to leverage a digital transformation and achieve growth in this current scenario of complexity, speed and frequent business disruptions. The term ecosystem, used by biology to define the relationship between living beings and the environment in which they live, was borrowed to also represent the interactions between organizations, suppliers, competitors, customers and other agents in the creation of value.

It is not today that organizations have realized that they do not have all the knowledge and technology necessary internally to continue transforming and innovating at the speed that gives them conditions to maintain high competitiveness. This awareness has driven many of them to approach new partners to add to their value chain.

However, many organizations still lose efficiency because they do not realize or are reluctant to accept that they cannot maintain their realization and delivery at optimal levels because they do not have sufficient mastery and maturity in all areas necessary to deliver their results. Not to mention the energy expenditure required to execute and produce elements that are not your core business. These organizations give up time and effort in their core business in an attempt to “embrace the world”. The level of expertise and technologies required to deliver solutions to the market has stimulated new partnerships, with the aim of “liberating” organizations to dedicate themselves only to their core.

Some conditions are important to act in a relevant way in an ecosystem. As well as establishing consistent partnerships. Initially, one must map and understand the participants of this universe, their actions and value deliveries. For this, you must understand what your organization is already doing today and also what it seeks to do. In addition to understanding where you want to go, it is necessary to envision which partners can help you transform and get there. It is also important to visualize how your customers benefit from value generation by this ecosystem. After understanding the dynamics of exchanges that occur, it is essential to identify which role your organization will play clearly and effectively. One must consider not only what it delivers of final value, but also what its greater purpose in the context in which it is inserted. From this point, it is possible to ask the following question: “Do we need to be able to produce and generate internally everything that is necessary to compose our proposal and delivery of value?”. A simple question, but of great importance.

Another important element to be considered is the identification of the different “roles” of action of different organizations in ecosystems. And the most prominent role is the so-called orchestrators. They work supported by digital platforms that facilitate interaction, exchange of value, knowledge and constant learning. We can cite one of the best known cases of orchestration of an ecosystem. Apple innovated the market in 2008 when it was able to create and integrate a broad market of solutions that span devices, applications, entertainment, productivity tools and other derivative products, not to mention all the value produced to a global ecosystem of applications, music and movies. If we analyze this case, Apple was able, at that time, to design and develop everything in-house. It had the capabilities needed to create any application to be made available. However, it decided to open up an ecosystem made up of businesses from several other segments to do that. In this way, it established win-win relationships with a wide range of organizations that saw the newly created ecosystem as a great business opportunity. And Apple has seen its smartphone sales soar.

But to envision new arrangements and ecosystems it is not necessary to cross borders. In Brazil we can see the increase in the creation and strengthening of interesting ecosystems. For example, premium and craft beers and how their presence boosted the emergence of a series of businesses that amplified the visibility of this segment and boosted its consumption. Micro-breweries, micro-nail shops, schools for brewers and tourist destination routes emerged with a focus on the appreciation of this product. Thus, the ecosystem is strengthened as new relationships emerge between its members, leading to the generation of value in win-win relationships.

Although the term “ecosystem” is already becoming fashionable, we cannot deny that it is a good term to describe how the business universe began to organize itself. Thus, we understand that, more than having our own assets, it is also important to have the ability to leverage capabilities, partnerships and, also, the ability to orchestrate relationships in the universe of ecosystems, identifying what really should be done “at home” and what is possible to carry out through business partners. The constant advancement of digital technology drives critical changes in organizations' ecosystems, making them larger, more complex and essential to strategy.

The modern leader needs vision and understanding of this great network to “connect the dots” that are most important for their customers and their organization.

And digital transformation permeates this issue, because without the identification and understanding of the importance of the business ecosystem, it is unlikely that the organization will be able to implement the transformation. And in this choice of partnerships, it is necessary to heal ecosystems that align with your digital purpose. You can say that today, it is much better to connect everything instead of trying to do everything.
