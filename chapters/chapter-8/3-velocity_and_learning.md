>In the movie "Lucy", Lucy is used as a drug mule without knowing it, the drug comes into contact with her digestive system and reacts in her body, gradually giving her superhuman physical and mental capabilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, electrokinesis. Absorbing knowledge instantly, even being able to travel in time.

In case you haven't noticed, innovation is one of the fuels that drive digital transformation and drives people and teams to engage in the creation and delivery of new ways of expanding skills and capabilities to produce value.

Objectively, to innovate is to start looking for answers and solutions that are in the future, that is, still residing in uncertainty. Dealing with this issue paralyzes many organizations, especially the more traditional ones, accustomed to linear structure, environment, relationships and processes. Innovation can no longer be seen as an exclusive activity of large organizations. On the contrary, the current scenario has shown some advantages that leaner structures have over more complex and vertical ones. To be able to constantly innovate and evolve in different aspects, organizations need to develop the ability to naturally deal with experimentation. Obviously, we are talking about experimenting with focus and with a clear intention to generate new learnings that expand problem solving and value creation.

To reach this condition, organizations need to break internal paradigms and expand actions to increase learning and new experiences. In addition, agility becomes a skill to be pursued, as there is little point in investing in experimentation if the process takes too long. In this case, at the end of the process, the “window” of opportunity has already closed, as well as the competitive landscape itself may have changed.

Digital transformation comes to establish the necessary foundation for the organization to give up creating time-consuming business cases and start having a structure that constantly and quickly learns about customers, innovation, technology and business models. For this to occur, the organization needs to make use of methodologies appropriate to the proposed agility. It must also implement process control, so that the inputs and outputs performed on each front of experimentation are clear and known and the due returns on these investments identified. From an organizational point of view, those who invest in innovation and have experimentation as part of their routine act as if several transdisciplinary startups coexist in their internal structure, working towards a common purpose. There is not much distinction between areas, but rather between project fronts.

In addition to the structural issue, the ability to learn with speed and experimentation requires a mindset capable of understanding and stimulating these dynamics. For example, dealing with the possibility of error is something that scares organizations, as their profit objectives do not allow room for error. Therefore, internal intrapreneurship initiatives are often unsuccessful and employees do not take risks with new ideas, for fear of being penalized if something goes wrong. One should not be obsessed with avoiding mistakes, but with failing fast and correcting even faster, creating opportunities for more creative achievement. Collaboration is also another element of the modern mindset, encouraging employees to expand their role, function or industry. Collaboration between different areas should be encouraged, generating a sense of ownership and responsibility, making employees start to think about the direction given by the organization. By empowering their employees more, organizations can build trust and motivation, and benefit from fresh ideas.

In the digital transformation journey, it is necessary to have the capital contribution to multiple work fronts, whether pivoting business models, proof of technology and concept, prototyping, minimum viable products, complete applications, as well as in the actions of automation of the business operation . A managed portfolio for maturation, with pre-defined outputs. It is not enough just to have the concepts or domains about practices and technologies, it is necessary to act on them so that learning takes place effectively, creating a solid knowledge base of failures and successes that evolves along the digital-continuum.
