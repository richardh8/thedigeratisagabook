>In the movie “Money Never Sleeps”, Jacob Moore is a promising young man in the investment world and seeks to create a fund for the development of a nuclear fusion project to generate clean energy for the world. But he is betrayed by the evil Gordon Gekko. After a plot and brief efforts, Jacob gets $100 million dollars for his valuable investment.

Have you ever thought about what the purpose of an organization is? What is your main role? Would it be to generate profit solely through its sales, whatever the cost of doing so? Many have already realized that this should not be the objective to be pursued, after all, there is no business with this bias that will last for a long time in the reality of today's markets. Gradually, we are seeing a concern beyond profits on the part of organizations. A movement in search of value generation to ecosystems.

Profit must be the result of purpose-driven action in an efficient way. Having only profit as a purpose no longer inspires or energizes people and does not attract professionals with the right vocation and commitment.

According to John Mackey and Raj Sisodia, authors of “Conscious Capitalism — How to Unleash the Heroic Spirit of Business”, business should not only be about making as much money as possible, but also about creating value for stakeholders. And value doesn't just mean money. And the stakeholders are not just the shareholders.

According to the authors, the so-called Conscious Capitalism is based on four principles:

Greater Purpose: Acting with a greater purpose, organizations go beyond simply generating and maximizing profit and creating a positive impact for all their stakeholders. Purpose and values ​​form the core of a conscious organization.

Stakeholder Integration: Stakeholders are all actors that impact or are impacted by an organization and are all equally important and connected by a sense of purpose and shared values. Thus, a “win-win” relationship is sought, preserving harmony and integration between the parties.

Conscious leadership: conscientious leaders must act, with levels of analytical, emotional and spiritual intelligence, so that they are able to reflect on the business and conduct it in a sophisticated way.

Conscious culture and management: fundamental factors for the practice of Conscious Capitalism, the strength and stability necessary for the preservation of the organization's greater purpose must be guaranteed. Trust, responsibility, transparency, personal growth, are some of the brands that move organizations with conscious purposes.

Although several organizations are interested in aligning their actions with broader purposes and committed to delivering value to the ecosystem, others, however, still practice only greenwashing, hiring advertising agencies to create slogans that try to reflect eventual purposes, which remain restricted to advertising concepts, hostages of one or another isolated action.

The purpose needs to be truly deep and authentic and capable of generating value for all stakeholders, for different types of leaders and cultures. While the financial returns are just consequences of achieving these goals. This movement finds several related aspects. In marketing, for example, we can see “Marketing 3.0”, in which Kotler emphasizes the importance of organizations focusing on delivering their value proposition first, including this objective in their mission, vision and values. 3 key elements are presented: collaborative marketing, based on the fact that the consumer uses the internet as a means to disseminate values; cultural marketing, with globalization boosting nations in socio-economic and cultural terms; and spiritual marketing, pointing out that consumers are looking for elements that satisfy their spiritual dimension.

Advances in digital technologies have allowed a level of connection and peer relationships never seen before. Thus, it is possible to promote value in different contexts, in front of stakeholders, increasingly aligning interactions and deliveries to the organization's purpose. However, for this to really happen, it is necessary to change the paradigm under which most organizations live: the unique and incessant search for profit.

We must also guide these value actions under the 3BL aspect, the “Triple Bottom Line”. A framework used by several organizations to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective in creating value for the business. 3BL introduces the concept of total cost accounting, including social, economic and ecological aspects to evaluate results in the production of value. It includes the responsibility of all stakeholders integrated in the value chain, whether in creation, production, influence and indirect actions. We can see how organizations that do not respond adequately to 3BL are being penalized by their consumers, media or governments due to cases of violence, abuse, pollution and data security.

On a journey of digital transformation, we must always consider how to connect to the market and people and create lasting purposes that allow the generation of
