>In the movie "The Founder", Ray Kroc meets the McDonald brothers, who had a single restaurant in San Bernardino. The brothers were not able to expand their business to other cities, as their high standards could not be maintained without them being there. Ray, after many failures, found the formula that would make McDonald's the largest franchise chain in the world.

The world of innovations has gained a disproportionate volume and frequency increase in the last 10 years. In fact, digital technology is the core element that has allowed so many new organizations to flourish that not only create disruptions in diverse markets globally, but bring new services and experiences to their users. The ability of organizations to master digital technologies has allowed them to solve problems so drastically that governments and regulatory institutions cannot keep pace. And the changes that these organizations bring to reality only tend to accelerate, creating more abundance for the population. Breaking barriers of political maps, people continue to march towards increasingly global processes and the inevitable predicted future where the Internet is the basis for our “Global Village”.

But we must recognize that only with technology an organization cannot promote and grow in this exponential fashion. The phenomenon of social networks, as well as freedom of expression, new trends in consumption and the breaking of certain paradigms in people's heads, provided a psychological phenomenon of natural gravitation of certain subjects and themes in given masses.

The population loves the new, and the reason is simple, the old has gone, enough of the headache of the proposals of certain organizations. And this population bets, even with risks. It is determined to make the crossing into a new society that yearns for justice, equality and a strong fraternal appeal. A new look at neighbors and a look at the sustainability of the planet.

And for that, digital transformation raises the bar for something beyond what was originally envisioned. Initially, the digital transformation came so that organizations can use new technologies such as: replacing IT with Cloud, developing an App to reduce the costs of physical presence, installing BigData to improve marketing, using Artificial Intelligence to replace human or use Blockchain as a cheaper way of trusting records.

Digital transformation comes to transform you, your mind, because the mere use of technologies will not help an organization to survive the growing movement that gains more space in the digital world, with its very strong effects in the physical world. As Salim Ismail said — “Eradicating disease, mastery of flight, global instant communication, going to the moon — human beings have developed a taste for making impossible things possible.”

So what do these organizations do that make so much noise and naturally gain fans all over the place. And they run over any marketing and advertising initiatives of such conventional and well-known brands.

The first part comes from your purpose, but it's not just any purpose. Your customers and fans demand new, high-impact purposes in their lives. It has to be transformative and it has to reach a lot of people. It has to be massive. The proper term here is Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP. Massive because it is greatly audacious, transformative. And it is transformative in that it causes significant transformation in the industry, community and the planet. In this trajectory of digital transformation, this proposal is not enough, it has to happen, otherwise, your customers and investors will disappear quickly.

Massive Transformative Purpose: Ideate, identify, interrogate, question, find the bold new purpose for your organization. What greatness and impact will you bring to the world? Challenge your own limitation, for the impossible only exists until someone does it. Without it, there is no digital transformation that will last and bring the expected results.

People: Through MTP, we gain the attention of the masses, who have an affinity with the organization's purpose, attracting people with talents and training who are eager to join this organization, and also, create a strong expectation in their consumers through narratives that enchant

New User Experience: The experience to be built cannot fall short of the expectations proposed by the MTP. A new experience has to emerge for users, dealing from pricing and acquisition, to post-sale of the solution, using innovative business practices.

Alliances and Partnerships: To deliver, one must have a clear vision of the alliances and partnerships that need to be made together with a unison ecosystem that will deliver the supplies, cutting edge technology, processes and innovative services in line with the delivery roadmap.

Development and Delivery: And finally, connecting technologies in a flexible, scalable architecture that can continually adapt to support new functionality and technologies.

It is necessary to radically change the way of thinking and acting, connecting and orchestrating people, experiences, partnerships and technologies. And so, making the impossible possible.
