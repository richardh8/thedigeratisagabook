>In the movie “Sully: Miracle on the Hudson”, Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger is an experienced pilot for US Airways, captaining Flight 1549 from LaGuardia New York to Charlotte. Three minutes after takeoff, both turbines are hit by birds at an altitude of 850 meters. He receives the tower's recommendation to return to the airport. With no thrust forces from the turbines and with 155 passengers on board, assessing the situation of the instruments, he decides to land in the Hudson River. Everyone was saved and no one was hurt, but Sully went through a lot of trials before the courts, until he pointed out the "human factor".

The business world is becoming more and more challenging. In this digital age, established businesses are constantly being challenged by new ideas, which are rapidly being materialized by small, dynamic organizations. We know that any organization to thrive must competently face the following challenges:

Solve your internal problems quickly and effectively to ensure quality in your products and services;

Expand your performance before your competitors to ensure your positioning and relevance;

Optimize your internal processes so that costs don't erode profits in the future.

The experiences of its leaders, the competence of its teams and the organization's internal capabilities are vital to overcome these challenges. However, it is very important that organizations can use as much information about their business and the environment as possible. Information about problems to be solved, information about how efficiently business is being conducted, and information about the environment in which the organization operates. Any decision made without the support of this information can be compared to trying to land a plane with no visibility and no instruments. Despite the pilots' great experience, the chance of a successful landing in these conditions is quite low. So, answering the title question. Is it possible to land a plane with no visibility and no instruments? The answer is: unlikely. Unless the pilot and all passengers are very lucky, even with all the experience.

Now, let's go back to the current reality of organizations and their businesses. Its leaders and teams are relentlessly making decisions so that their organizations can face the challenges we listed above. And many of these decisions are strategic and vital enough that they could be compared to the decisions made by pilots during high-risk landings. Now, imagine if several of these decisions are being made without your decision makers having all the necessary information? Relying only on your experience and a few good hunches and intuition? In the case of pilots, without information from their instruments, at each moment of decision, they would have to try to find the landing strip just by feeling and try to identify speed and height only by references such as noise and brief moments of very limited visibility of the plane. environment around.

For those who like to live great emotions and great risks, this can be an exciting life, but it doesn't have to be that way. And for that, it is enough that the decision makers, as well as the pilots, have all the important information available at critical moments. Decision makers can make faster, more assertive and informed decisions, just as pilots can land a plane in very adverse conditions, without their passengers (customers) having the slightest idea of the risk they could have taken if such information were not available.

A digital organization has in its culture the generation and use of digital data in practically all its areas, from data about people's attitudes, their interactions, data about their internal processes and even about interactions with their customers, even when such interactions take place in the physical (offline) world. And, above all, this generation and use of data takes place in a corporate and consistent way, avoiding ambiguities and conflicts. We call this the single source of truth. The continued elevation of an organization's maturity in the generation and use of digital data allows it to "surf" in the current scenario, always remaining competitive and vibrant.
